"If the Ingall Municipality is supported in the rehabilitation of a well in Idouragh then this will increase community perceptions that the government has the capacity to address conflict, respond to an urgent community need, and improve the water management system, which will improve relations between targeted communities and the authorities. This assumes that the authorities will provide a collaborative environment to educate its constituents around the legalities of access to water and implement a strategy to address conflict in a constructive way and that the well rehabilitation will increase access to water.  If there is buy in and support from all stakeholders, then this activity will decrease community and ethnic conflict around water, so that Niger can continue to be socially cohesive and resistant to regional pressures of instability.

"If the Youth and Culture Center (MJC), managed by the Youth Departmental Office of Arlit and the Arlit Municipality, is provided with professional equipment which will facilitate high quality programming, then the local community, including youth, will be more likely to attend events.  This will demonstrate to the youth and the community at large that the MJC is an active institution and relations will be improved between the local community, including youth, and the authorities. This assumes that the provision of equipment will lead to more meetings, interactions and cultural events.  If the MJC hosts three performances focused on issues currently impacting youth (substance abuse prevention, peace and tolerance promotion, and nonviolent conflict mitigation), then large numbers of youth will participate in the events.  If they participate in the events, then this exchange will contribute to changing their behaviors as they will not only share this new knowledge with their counterparts but also see positive alternatives to violence and crime. They will also discover new activities and other forms of entertainment via the MJC which will in return decrease the interest among youth to participate in illicit or extremist activities."
"If the Dannet municipality is supported to organize an Awareness Caravan that includes 15 information meetings and 5 workshops on conflict resolution, rural and land codes and the water management manual, then community feelings that the government has the capacity to respond to local conflict and increase community knowledge of conflict resolution will increase. This is possible because government authorities and community and traditional leaders will participate in the Caravan and will be the ones explaining the rural and land codes, as well as the water management manual. If traditional authorities who are influential and respected in their communities are included, then this activity will increase the utilization of local conflict resolution mechanisms around natural resources. Eventually, this will decrease community and ethnic conflict around natural resources in an area particularly vulnerable to conflict so that Niger can continue to be socially cohesive and resistant to regional pressures of instability.

"Residents in Agadez often lack knowledge of democratic principles or access to this knowledge. If the ‘Agadez Peace Capital' Festival is supported by covering costs for a youth forum, a publi administration open day, a camel race, communication, as well as transport, accommodation and catering for the guests, then citizen access to information about cultural initiatives, youth entrepreneurship, functioning of administrations and on citizens' rights and duties will increase.

"With the production of these live radio debates, youth will be provided with an environment enabling them to speak on their own behalf rather than under the influence of others. They will be offered a positive outlet for discussion, advocacy and representation of their perspectives on issues currently affecting them and their society. If youth are able to express their feelings on these issues, then this will promote a better understanding among the community in regards to youth needs and perspectives and contribute to changing the way young people and adults think about each other and communicate. If this communication gap is bridged, then it will facilitate youth engagement with authorities and viceversa as local governments may be inclined to take action to address youth challenges discussed on the radio programs. If youth can challenge and inspire Nigerien authorities to see young people as capable of offering solutions rather than creating problems, then this will increase their contribution to the development of the society and their positive engagement in their communities. If the youth are empowered, they will become selfreliant, confident and able to assert their independence by making more positive choices and decisions thus reducing their likelihood to engage in illicit activities or join terrorist groups. Their positive engagement will not only be visible with this activity but with other parallel activities such as the youth training activity on advocacy on Facebook. "

"The community does not understand the government's efforts to promote stability and security in the region in a meaningful way.

"If costs are supported for the organization of a site selection mission, a peace training, gold mining equipment, food and transportation for 100 youth beneficiaries to engage in gold mining for a period of 3 months in the Agadez region, then the dismissed youth's perception of the government will change because the government has responded to a community priority of providing alternative economic opportunities for the youth laidoff from the Imouraren and Azelik uranium sites. This assumes that that the government will support the security and the success of this activity and that the youth will recognize this support. If the beneficiaries' perception are changed, then the community including the beneficiaries' families and the youth in particular will feel supported by the government which will in turn increase citizens' trust and confidence in their government.

"Using sociocultural expressions of highly popular artists during the Cure Salée will increase the quality of the event.  If Cure Salée participants from a wide array of ethnic backgrounds and cultures listen to messages of peace and understanding broadcast by the authorities and artistic groups then they will have a better understanding of the importance of social cohesion in Niger and the GoN's support of it as a shield against violent extremism. If citizens, civil society and government leaders experience meaningful interactions, their mutual trust and confidence will increase, which will contribute to the heightening of feelings of inclusion and connectedness, which will foster social cohesion and contribute to stability in Niger."
"The provision of food and drinks to the Ingall Prefecture during the Cure Salée will support a strategic government partner of the NCCI. If the event is supported, then key individuals will be incentivized to attend the festival in an inhospitable desert environment. If participation is increased the NCCI program may be provided with additional perspectives, contacts, and insight into the Agadez region. Increased participation of key individuals could reinforce participants' understanding of the consequences of insecurity and support for reinforcing social cohesion among communities in Ingall and other areas in the Agadez region.

"If a Crafts Fair gathering all communities of Agadez commune, including the Tubu and Tuareg communities is organized, then positive perceptions between the groups will improve.Because:Tubu and Tuareg communities have been subject to increased tensions following the conflict outbreak in Libya.The communities rarely have the opportunity to interact and share attributes of their cultureInter ethnic tensions will not be exacerbated by interactions at the cultural fairThe cultural fair will require the groups to work towards a common goalThe grantee of this project will be the Sultan of l'Air, a figure greatly respected by both groups, and a key mediator in the Tubu/Tuareg conflictFostering mutual understanding of the Tubu/Tuareg cultures will contribute to easing tensions between the two communities and improving shared tolerance."
"If NCCI supports the Sultanate to travel for 7 days to engage with communities and broadcast messages of peace concomitant to an important cultural gathering in Aguelal, this will contribute to increased knowledge and understanding of peace culture to prevent the intensification of radicalization in Agadez. Ultimately, this will contribute to increase atrisk youth understanding of the realities, dangers, and risks of illicit and extremist activities.Because: Sultan is the custodian of all major cultural events in the region, and a key figure to addressing communities as he is wellrespected figure and customary authority in the Agadez region This cultural event constitute an appropriate moment to gather, and address massive amounts of people as participants will be attentive and have travelled to attend such an event An increased knowledge of Agadez residents on the dangers of extremism and the value of peace culture, will contribute to fight counter extremist rhetoric and lower the temptation among youth to join such groups"
"If a conference room is rehabilitated a conference room is equipped within the premises of Arlit Prefecture then civil society exchanges will increase through the provision of a suitable venue for meetings and trainings.   Because:At one time the existing conference room was frequented by CSOs. Now, with the room's disrepair, it is rarely occupied.CSOs in Arlit are deprived of a suitable facility to have regular meetings and conduct their activitiesCSO hold authorities accountable for their mismanagement of the facility which has been left unattended in a dilapidated stateRehabilitating the conference room will restore confidence and improve positive perceptions between the Prefecture and CSO in ArlitCSOs states that the rehabilitation of the space is a priority for them  The room will create a common space for likeminded organizations to gather as well as create a communal space in Arlit town "
"If 100 youth from Teblelik and other villages nearby are trained in nonviolent conflict management and are temporarily hired to clear the brush, then perspectives that the government has responded to a community priority will be increased and the security situation in the area of Teblelik and in the region will be improved because: 100 unemployed youth at risk will be dissuaded to participate in extremist or illicit activities such as banditry ; They will be trained on how to manage a conflict that may rise in the community or between their community and another; The bandits threatening local and regional security from the brush will be deprived from their hideout; Youth will be actors of their own communities' security; Communities that are cohesive, participate in their own security and have strong linkages to responsive government are more resistant to violent extremism; The government will demonstrate that it can meet the security needs of the population."
"If an essay competition and discussions in six public and private secondary schools of Agadez commune on the topics of peace and conflict are conducted, then the critical thinking of school children on themes of peace and conflict in Agadez communities will be improvedBecause:Youth rarely have an opportunity to receive feedback on their personal thoughts or opinions in the school environment and share this work with their peersThe spirit of competition and engaging in personal expression through the written word will encourage social bonding between groups and strengthen relationships between students within the same school or from different schools that will encourage ""group think"" on issues of peace Messages passed during the competition will stand as a counternarrative to violent/ hate speech that youth may have been exposed toSuch a competition will engage local educational institutions on the themes of peace and conflict, underlining its importance in youth development and learning at all levelsYouth that do not choose to participate in the competition will also be afforded the opportunity to engage on these topics"
"If Azelik's agricultural area is rehabilitated and the youth are equipped with materials to engage in gardening, then a sense of opportunity and alternative options for youth will be fostered at the local level. Because:Many youth possess skills in agriculture/gardening, but have been unable to use these skills at home due to climate changes and lack of resources to restore the affected lands Scarce employment opportunities in the region have led to massive youth departure to neighboring countries Youth who have mobilized considerable resources to leave their country returned to their home country without opportunities to earn a living which has increased feelings of marginalization, as there seems there is no way for them to ‘get ahead' Developing the land will encourage youth who may be seriously considering leaving for Libya or Nigeria during the Soudure period to stay. This income will then be bolstered by longer term opportunities provided by the gardening site that may allow them to remain in their villages as seen in its preliminary phases for AGA046 Youth would develop a sense of ownership for the parcels they are in charge of gardeningNew sources of income generation within the community will raise enthusiasm and feelings of pride within villages "
"If a seven day peace camp in Aderbissanat, Agadez is conducted by the Religious Observatory, then 100 interfaith youth will exchange on issues of tolerance, cooperation, and coexistence under the direction of positive and influential organization.Because:The peace camp is a wellestablished event in Agadez that attracts key leaders and figures within civil society that are respected by youthThe camp will bring together youth of multiple faiths, demonstrating the power of learning about and accepting the background and experiences of othersYouth will spread the knowledge and experiences they have had during the camp within their communities to achieve a ripple effectYouth are not often afforded the opportunity to critically think about and discuss religious diversity and tolerance of that diversity as Nigerien society is often presented as solely Muslim, thus the opportunity to exchange will be well receivedYouth selected for the camp will have the capacity to engage on the issues presented and instructors of various modules will ensure that curriculum considers the level of the participants "
" If a 3day CVE training in Agadez for 24 members of 8 Agadez CSOs is organized  and a common action plan and CVE agenda for Agadez is authored, then capacity to act on CVE, organizational management and community resilience related issues for 24 Agadez CSO members will be increased because: There currently is no CVE debate among civil society as the CVE paradigm is relatively new in the region This training will contribute to inform civil society organizational strategies and bring all CSOs to the table to reflect on a common CVE action plan The implication of civil society actors in the fight against violent extremism is critical due to their knowledge of communities and relations built among communitiesCSOs have recognized the importance of these issues in their communities and will be willing to participate "
"If the NCCI program procures the Agadez Eveil network office equipment and furniture, then their operational capacity to advance their agenda and ability to move forward with their regional mission statement to counter violent extremism in Agadez region will be enabled: Agadez Eveil is a multidisciplinar network of local CSOs which members Agadez Eveil have previously received CVE training, coaching and have garnered the operational skill to develop their own vision  Members of Agadez are committed and motivated to tackle the issue of violent extremism in Agadez region Appropriate equipment and furniture will help establish Agadez as a reference point in Agadez and create a hub of actionoriented CSOs against violent extremism.

"If 50 youth from the Departmental Youth Council (CDJ) are temporarily hired to dig waste pits and collect waste on the Cure Salée site, then atrisk youth will be provided with the opportunity to engage with government counterparts and communities during a national event. Because:The authorities have been held accountable by the population for the poor management of the organization of the Cure Salée in years past. PCCN supported sanitation at the previous Cure Salée which was well received by community members. Having the authorities committed to clean up the Cure Salée site will generate feelings of pride among the population as it will positively impact on the reputation of the event.Youth in the region are disempowered and lack opportunities, leading to their being the primary actors currently involved in armed robberies, violent intercommunity feuds, and engagement in illicit/illegal trading.  Involving atrisk youth in community works will improve their investment in their community and reduce the risk that they join or encourage others to join extremist groups of trafficking networks."
"If a training on pastoral law for Fulani and Tuareg community leaders is organized, then risks of tensions between both communities before, during and after the Cure Salée will be reduced because:Damages caused by cattle herds crossing villages and agricultural areas are a serious source of tensions between Fulanis and TuaregsPastoral law provide rules to prevent those tensionsPastoral law and community rights are little known by communitiesCommunity leaders will settle conflicts on the basis of standard rules instead of casebycase ruling Community leaders having received the training will do restitutions to their communities Cure Salée is the ideal moment to discuss community issues on breeding "
"If NCCI supports the organization of a cash for work activity coupled with a leadership training for 80 women and youth from Iferouane cooperatives to brush clear invasive prosopis, then the knowledge and efficiency of local leaders will be increased through networking, contributing to the reinforcement of local leaders capacity to face extremist violence because:  Women would have reinforced their leadership through the set up of a project aiming at increasing community security Women would have assumed responsibility and would have ensure the implementation of a sizable proportion with women from other groups and in interaction with FDS women Women would benefit from an extended network of women with whom they will be able to communicate and will understand how to recognize leaders and interact with them within their cooperatives "
"If a training on leadership for 45 community leaders of Iferouane commune is conducted which includes discussion on their conceptual and practical understandings of social justice, the future of the youth and their implications in Niger's security,and the culture of tolerance, then the ability of community leaders to more effectively engage with communities will be increased through knowledge of democratic processes and a clarified problem set.  Because:This activity will offer a suitable venue for community leaders to learn more about the issues each of them is facing in his community and the various responses developed by them to address newly arising issues, as well as best practices for community engagement Community leaders are listened to by community members, therefore their influence is essential to ultimately preventing the penetration or spread of violent extremism within communitiesTensions among communities have been more and more visible in Iferouane Based on the nature of the discussions, this activity will be an opportunity for NCCI to identify potential followon activities more focused on handon experience for community leaders in CVE"
"If NCCI organizes a sensitization campaign targeted at youth from 10 fadas of Agadez town, and mobilizes youth in participatory theater performances, then youth comprehension of the risks linked to violent extremist propaganda on social networks will be increased because: Theater is a proven medium to spread strategic nonviolent peacemessaging particularly among youth without high levels of standard education Agadez Regional Youth Council is a youth organization actively listening to youth and the issues they face in the region Performances will reflect situations common to the local context, passing messages in a way youth will understand The sensitization campaign will take place in 10 different sensitive neighborhoods of Agadez town during Agadez Sokni, a major event in Agadez.

"If musical and theater performances are organized in 12 targeted villages of Iferouane region that are vulnerable to extremist influence and later broadcast on a local community radio, then communities will be engaged and exposed to strategic messages on peace/security. Their knowledge on peace, social cohesion and security will be improved which will help them recognize and define the CVE problem at the local level. Traditional guitar brings communities together and is powerful way to assemble an audience Akou Theater Troupe is a locally renowned troupe that has garnered awarenessraising experience in If erouane Tamgak FM is the only community radio station to cover the majority of targeted villages within a 90km range Using local actors to address communities through arts in their own languages is a powerful communication method to massively disseminate messages of peace, security and social cohesion Theater provides constructive entertainment for youth living in an unstable area Performances will foster personal reflection and open the conversation which will ultimately help local communities to recognize the security challenges they face"
"If two fourday CVE trainings in Agadez for 80 local leaders of the Agadez region are held, then local leaders' knowledge of CVE will be increased and their ability to act on CVE and community resilience related issues will be increased because: This training will inform local leaders on Agadezspecific issues and bring them to a common, shared understanding of the threats;  Leaders will be asked during the training to reflect on a possible future common CVE action plan The implication of local leaders in the fight against violent extremism is critical as they constitute the bridge between the communities and the government"

"If 10 district committees are established for women of Iferouane town to discuss CVE and community cohesion themes, then women will be enabled to further engage in countering violent extremism at the community level.

"If a threeday meeting for 60 local leaders of 20 villages of Iferouane commune to exchange on issues related to VE and community cohesion is organized, then leaders will become more aware of warning signs of VE, how to respond, and ways to build up community resilience to the threatBecause:The organization of meetings where local leaders, from different and sometimes remote villages, have the opportunity to discuss/exchange on security issues affecting their communities is virtually nonexistent. Connectivity between leaders is often low.

"If key trained youth from iferouane conduct “tea debates” organized in local fadas, plan and attend a soirée de l'engagement and take part in a local volunteer action, then the ability of these young leaders to engage their peers on social and security issues will increase because:  There is currently no structured and efficient communication framework for young leaders in their interactions with the youth Fadas are an ideal place to discuss the issues youth in Iferouane face Cultural exchanges, skits and animations are an efficient way to mobilize and promote values, especially with the youth The young people of Iferouane don't have an extensive knowledge of the risks and dangers of violent extremism         Trained youth will  have the space to bring issues of cohesion and violence to the floor elevating their influence in the community       "

"If 20 community gatherings in different fadas are organized in Agadez by the Communal Youth Council (CCJ), then youths' ideas concerning community priority issues will gain greater visibility and consideration because:  Youth feel that local authorities do not respect their opinions and do not invite them into decisionmaking spaces Communities are not mindful of the importance of youth feedback in determining community priorities/projects  The youth are currently facing a specific set of obstacles vis à vis new migration policies and a protracted economic crisis in the region Fadas are traditionally important to Niger and are recognized as an important part of the community fabric CCJ has proven positive influence over the youth through past activities  "
"If the young leaders of Agadez have a meeting with local authorities and local representatives followed by debates between young people on community issues; then youth will be provided with an opportunity to analyse community issues and provide solutions, demonstrating their civicmindedness, because: Public organized youthfocused exchanges will improve their image amongst those of the older generation who often underestimate youth leadership and capacities Young people lack the ability and venue for consultation and exchange with elected officials Young people lack opportunities for representation in public debate and decision making which contributesto their feelings of marginalizatio Youth in Agadez lack the organizational skills for civic action in many localities "

"
"If we support the training of inhabitants in fifteen (15) villages and neighborhoods on democratic processes, regulatory frameworks, responsibilities and rights of the Community Action Boards (JACs) for implementation of the peace agreement, then we will promote the participation of the JACs in the implementation of peace agreements with the FARC, because: (1) the community is in need of accurate information regarding the advances in the peace talks, (2) the JACs are a key player in the implementation of the peace aggreements at the submunicipal and community levels, and (3) JACs with access to information about communal and participatory mechanisms will promote its role as a social organization that brings together efforts and resources to meet the needs of the community and promote citizen participation around the implementation of the peace agreements."
"If we provide, on behalf of the OACP, skilled labor, materials and technical assistance to the Local Community Action Board of Caño Negro in the town of Saravena, for the remodeling of their community center, then we will help increase the credibility of the Colombian government (OACP) in three communities historically influenced by illegal armed groups, paving the way for implementation of the Havana agreement and helping communities to see tangible benefits of the negotiated agreement; because: 1) the community and the local Community Action Board members do not have a proper meeting place for coming together to discuss key issues and activities related to preparations for the Havana agreement and their community needs; and 2) the community members have emphasized that they must see concrete actions made by the OACP and the Colombian government in order to foment trust and credibility. "
"If we support the design and implementation of training methodologies with concepts of peaceful coexistence and peacebuilding in the villages of Campo Oscuro, Buenos Aires y Caño Negro, in the municipality of Saravena, then we will increase the credibility of the government in communities who are influenced by illegally armed actors, to implement peace agreements, because: (1) the community is interested indeveloping and actively participating in the workshops; (2) the community is open to contributing individual capacities for future common benefit; and (3) the OACP is committed to accompanying and being the public face of the activity."

"If we offer logistic support and we hired a technical team to formulate and endorsed by the Makaguan people to draw up the rules of action to strengthen the Indigenous government within the framework of its ""Plan Salvaguarda"", in coordination with the Ministry of Interior.

"
"If we conduct an action research study on the recycling of armed groups, violence and sociopolitical dynamics and their relevance to the peace negotiations with the FARC and the ELN;ThenIt will increase the capacity of local governments and civil society in the El Sarare subregion to understand local dynamics of recycling of armed groups and violence that will enable them to implement effective rapid response activities that support the peace agreement;Because Authorities and civil society will be empowered with more information and knowledge about new changes in the realignment of power in the region; considering that currently there is no clear, up to date understanding of precisely how recycling of armed groups and new violence will interact with, and potentially derail, peace agreement implementation; and, considering this reality, information is needed to define what rapid response activities in support of peace accord implementation are be most effective. "
"If We provide equipment and strategic communications training to the community radio station Sarare Stereo to develop spots on the progress of the peace process, using local language and content;ThenWe will increase the capacity of community radio in the department of Arauca to serve as a mechanism for facilitating discussion on the role of local communities in the implementation of peace agreements; Because there is a critical lack of access to communitylevel information on the progress and content of the peace agreements and community leaders have highlighted this need:  community radio has proven to be a respected and effective medium for strategic communications and facilitating constructive and peaceful communitylevel discussions between stakeholders on the peace agreements;  Sarare Stereo is the community radio station with widest coverage and highest level of interest in leading this activity. "
"If We support children's book clubs in five rural communities, led by the cultural Association Letras y Voces (ASOCLEVOZ), in the municipalities of Fortul, Tame and Arauquita,ThenWe will strengthen the capacity of the Association Letras y voces ASOCLEVOZ to encourage coexistence and  peaceful environments in rural communities,Because The FORTULEE program is well recognized in the area, communitities are eager to participate in the literary circles and communities will learn the importance in promoting peaceful coexistence and learn to engage in dialogue with others. "
"If We provide quick support to execute community action board (JAC) trainings and informational events with delegates from JACs and the High Commissioner for Peace in Tame on the Havana peace agreement and implementation.Then,We will expand Tame community action board leadership, internal capacity and access to information on the Havana peace agreement for agreement implementation support in strategic communities.

"
"If We support the Arauquita municipality community action boards (JAC) with improvements to their association office (e.g. small equipment, furniture) and conduct workshops (e.g. travel, meals, event logistics) with members on coexistence, conflict resolution and their role in Havana peace agreement implementation.ThenWe will strengthen Arauquita JAC leadership, conflict resolution capacity and access to information on the Havana peace agreement, thereby increasing the positive role JACs can play in Havana peace agreement implementation in strategic communities.

"If we Support FEDEJUNTAS (Community Action Committees) with logistics (transportation, food, basic equipment) to bring its members to a central meeting place for their annual meeting in preparation for Havana peace agreement implementation in Arauca;ThenWe will increase key Community Action Committee leaders´ motivation and understanding of the Havana peace agreement and their role in implementation in their respective communities.  BecauseCommunity Action Committees and their leaders are wellrespected and positioned to help lead Havana peace agreement information socialization and eventual implementation in their communities.Community Action Committees are key actors for increasing communitylevel collaboration and participation for focusing efforts and resources for peace agreement preparations and implementation. The security conditions and threats to community leaders are maintained under control allowing the Community Action Committee leaders to travel and actively participate. "
"If we provide lodging, food and hydration, awards, arbitration and uniforms for the 540 youth participating in the ""Departmental Basketball Festival Making Baskets for Peace in Arauca"";THENWe will help the Saravena mayor´s office start increasing trust and credibility with citizens in critical conflict communities, human rights protection, violence prevention and peaceful coexistence through basketball tournaments with at risk youth in preparation for peace agreement implementation;BECAUSEThe Saravena mayor´s office has demonstrated itself as a potential change agent for promoting inclusion of youth, increased trust with citizens as well as for human rights protection, violence prevention and peaceful coexistence; Work with the Saravena mayor´s office and atrisk youth using sports / basketball could provide an effective entry point for future activities;The OACP has been proactive about selecting Saravena as a key Arauca municipality for Havana agreement preparations and exploring opportunities  such as the basketball festival  to increase its presence in the territories;The security conditions, including the ongoing national strike, permit the activity preparation and implementation. "
"If the ASODES Home for Victims has fully functional infrastructure and the Mayor´s Office, Victim´s Unit and civil society work together;ThenThe conflict victim's reparations and assistance will be expanded in Arauquita and ASODES community members will see tangible Havana peace agreement rapid response and local service delivery beginning to happen;BecauseConflictvictim´s reparations and assistance is one of the most sensitive and tangible issues raised by ASODES members that they feel must be addressed in order to build new confidence and help them turn towards peace;A sense of commitment and collaboration has already begun to develop between the Arauquita Mayor´s office, the Victim´s Unit and ASODES / civil society members for victim´s support and preparing for peace together; "
"If we support the Association of Farmer´s Markets of Todos los Santos with logistical support (travel, meals, lodging, technical assistance) for banana producer leaders and Arauca municipal government officials for an experience exchange tour;ThenWe can promote opportunities for experience exchanges among banana producer leaders and municipal officials to improve their agricultural practices in the framework of rapid response and implementation of the Havana peace agreement.

"
"If we strengthen the municipal government and the Tame Youth Platform to build trust, take back public spaces and prepare youth leaders as key partners for peace agreement implementation;Then,Youth will be empowered to share their views and play a leadership role with the Tame municipal government and Tame Youth Platform in territorial peace agreement implementation; BecauseThe mayor´s office representatives in Tame have identified youth as a demographic at risk and also as a demographic with important leadership contributions to develop for peace agreement implementation;Youth can be important change agents in their communities for peacebuilding, leadership and helping to develop a vision for the future framed in the peace process; The Tame Youth Platform members and the Tame mayor´s office want to organize the peacebuilding workshops and the concerts, but they lack the logistical capacities and resources to do so; There is a specific window of opportunity for this activity as the peace agreement is about to be signed, and implementation will begin within two months. "
"If we strengthen abilities of youth from rural conflictaffected communities in Arauca through agricultural, leadership and peacebuilding development;THENWe will help empower youth to be change agents in their rural communities for Havana Peace Agreement implementation and the territorial peacebuilding process;BECAUSEA primary barrier to empowering rural youth from rural conflictaffected communities across Arauca is the lack of practical educational opportunities focused on agriculture, leadership and peacebuilding. There is a serious ""generation gap"" between youth and their elders, which is a serious risk for Havana Peace Agreement implementation at the territorial level if youth are not quickly engaged as a key cadre of change agents. If youth are not quickly engaged in constructive activities that strengthen their abilities for agriculture, peacebuilding and leadership, many will end up in the vicious cycle of becoming migrant labor or enter illegal armed groups causing greater insecurity and violence in the department during the transition period. "
"IfJAC members from strategic communities in Tame and Arauquita near concentration zones (ZVTNs) have open dialogues and are versed in the Havana peace agreement; Then They will be able to act as rapid response change agents for providing neutral and official information on the Havana peace agreement to mitigate concerns and tensions among receptor and neighoring community members about the presence of concentartion zones and excombatants; BecauseNegative rumors and incorrect information circulating among Tame and Arauquita community members and leaders about the the concentration zones is are creating tensions and concerns; Community members do not have access to official, neutral information about the content and implications of the Havana peace agreement, and they have made numerous requests for this support; The JACs are a proven, trusted community level actor that is interested and willing to receive the orientations and then work to inform their respective community members. "
"If the  Community Action Boards in Puerto Jordan conduct joint actions with common goals, such as participating in coexistence events and improving and equipping their community center together; ThenThe tensions that have historically divided the Community Action Board members and kept them from working together will be overcome and they will be able to take on new leadership roles uniting their communities, mitigating conflicts and supporting peace agreement implementation; BecauseMistrust between the  Community Action Boards in Puerto Jordan, Tame, has been a roadblock to progress and joint work for peace. The JACs of Puerto Jordan have expressed interest in overcoming their conflicts and working together for peace in the territory. The JACs have an important role to play at the community and territorial level with peace agreement implementation and peacebuiding.Conflicts between demobilizing FARC members and still active ELN members do not affect community tensions. "
"IfASONET AfroColombian leaders in Tame have improved abilities and operational capacity to expand public dialogues on the Final Peace Agreement and conflict victim´s legislation; ThenASONET leaders will be able to be more effective and have greater influence in decisionmaking and participatory processes related to AfroColombian specific community roles in implementation and ethnic conflict victim´s assistance; BecauseThe department of Arauca and Tame municipality have concentrations of AfroColombian populations whose history and special needs and contributions must be taken into account. ASONET is wellrespected and influential among AfroColombians, civil society and local government; however, they are not fully prepared for the Final Peace Agreement implementation in their communities. They have limited knowledge and understanding of the Final Peace Agreement as well as conflict victim´s legislation as it applies to AfroColombian minorities. They also lack basic equipment to carry out their activities and participate effectively.Lack of representation of AfroColombians at the communitylevel is a factor that can create tensions with other ethnic and civil society groups, and affect the early stages of implementation. "
"IfFundacion con Vida prepares, reviews and monitors, Colombia Transforma's Environmental Monitoring and Mitigation Plans (EMMP) for small infrastructure and income generation activities and ensures Transforma's compliance with Colombian law and USAID regulations related to environmental monitoring and mitigation; ThenColombia Tranforma will successfully mitigate the negative impact of such activities on the environment while implementing small infrastructure and income generation activities in key communities designed to take advantage of windows of opporunity in key communities for the Havana accords. ; BecauseTransforma activities must ensure that environmental monitoring and mitigation plans are used when required in order to reduce / minimize environmental impacts per Colombian law and USAID regulations; Transforma has a number of important small infrastructure and income generation activities that require EMMPs, which must progress quicly; Fundacion con Vida has technical expertise in environmental monitoring and mitigation, understands Colombian law and USAID regulations, and has developed EMMPs that can be implemented using USAID OTI's busines model for activities that must be designed and implemented quickly."
"Si se apoya la organizacion de encuentros de dialogos y formacion en municipios estragegicos liderado por la OACP; EntoncesSe promoverán espacios de diálogo constructivo entre la OACP y comunidades con el fin de dar claridades y responder a sus preocupaciones sobre los pasos, tiempos y roles de implementación de los acuerdos y se aumentará la capacidad de gestionar acciones para la construcción de paz en zonas priorizadas de alta y muy alta afectación por el conflicto.Porque La OACP ha identificado la necesidad critica de expandir su presencia en comunidades prioritarias cerca de las ZVTN y de alta y muy alta afectación para abrir la comunicación y participación de diversos actores de las comunidades para transformar sus preocupaciones y tensiones que pueden volver desestabilizadores que afectan la implementacion.

"IfProvide timely support to key department and municipal governments to create or reactivate their Municipal Peace Councils; ThenWe will generate new opportunities for active citizen participation and coresponsibilities with government for peacebuilding and agreement implementation in critical municipalities. BecauseThe National Government (Office of the High Commissioner for Peace and High Council for PostConflict) require the preparation of territories and regions identified as High and Very High Conflict municipalities for the implementation of the Peace Accords.The Municipal Peace Councils are spaces where the civilian population can participate and discuss topics and actions that concern their municipalities in the framework of Havana peace agreement implementation. It will enable local leaders and other territorial allies to have additional tools for their peacebuilding work, which will in turn facilitate followup by the national government for peace agreement implementation."
"If enable the Arauca department government to strengthen new JAC technical capacities and commitment to their roles in community peace agreement preparation and implementation;Then JACs in Saravena and Fortul municipalities will take on new commitments and visible leadership roles that will increase peace agreement preparations and implementation effectiveness with their communities;Because based on the effectiveness of ARA019 and ARA024, the Arauca government has justified the need for rapid technical capacitybuilding and JAC leadership preparation for peace preparation and implementation. giving JACs more robust technical and legal information / tools, and bringing their members together, will help to unite their efforts across communities and be more effective responding to their communities´ needs and participation in peace preparation and implementation. the JACs have been identified by Transforma, department, municipal and national government entities, as key change agents / catalytic leaders at the community / submunicipal level  essentially they are the link between communities  villages, and municipal and department governments. "
"If we help the Arauca government demonstrate its community and tangible benefits of peace through dairy production improvements as well as build trust and collaboration with Asoganaderos members in Panama de Arauca; ThenWe will help to increase government and small producer associations coordination of rapid response activities together within the framework of the implementation of the peace accords.Becausethere are producer and community associations, like Asoganaderos, who remain skeptical about the peace process and the final agreement as they lack information and tanglible evidence that they will benefit. the Arauca department government has little contact with remote conflictaffected communities like Panama de Arauca, which are critical geographies for making progress with peacebuilding and eventual agreement implementation.Asoganaderos members distrust government and have little past experiences of positive collaboration in their communities. Rapid response activities, such as the Asoganaderos infrastructure improvements, are critical for demonstrating early victories and tangible benefits to being involved in peace implementation. "
"If we help open new spaces for dialogue on the Peace Agreement between Arauca guild members and small producers, government, chambers of commerce and the OHCP;ThenGuild members and small producers will have their concerns addressed regarding the Peace Agreement and agrarian reform (Point #1) as well as build new credibility and collaboration to advance implementation with department government, chambers of commerce and the OHCP;Becuase There is a general lack of knowledge and high uncertainty among the guilds and small producers of Arauca and Saravena about ararian reform and the role they should play in the implementation of the Peace Agreement. Capturing the interest of these key actors is vital because they would inform their members about the Peace Agreement as they are recognized leaders in their communities.Creating synergies between communitylevel stakeholders, department government and national entities in charge of aspects of the Peace Agreement is an effective means for increasing collaboration and credibility. "
"IF We help to increase opportunities for joint work between government (national OACP, municipal Saravena) and three rural conflictaffected communities;THENWe will help build trust and collaboration between the national government  OACP, Saravena municipal government and rural conflict affected communities  especially youth for their roles in the peace process; BECAUSEThe Office of the High Commissioner for Peace (OACP) needs to build trust, credibility and working relationships with strategic communities for peace agreement implementation, including municipal government and youth stakeholders; High levels of distrust between conflictaffected rural communities of Saravena where the FARC and ELN have a had a strong presence must be quickly addressed to help make way for peace agreement implementation and territorial peace; Presence of armed groups with strong influence over communities has made entry for Transforma and government programs very challenging and the focusing on youth and sports is a costeffective means for entry. "
"IfIf the Arauca department and municipal conflict victim´s roundtable members have the opportunity to hold open dialogue with key government actors involved with Peace Agreement implementation that results in their increased understanding, buyin and participation; Then Conflict victim roundtable leaders and their members will be more engaged and able to play a more constructive, participatory and influential role in Peace Agreement implementation, particularly regarding Point #5 on Conflict Victims; BecauseArauca conflict victims are concerned about Peace Agreement implementation and what the specific roles and benefits of conflict victims will be. Conflict victims round table leaders are important and influential civil society actors who must be taken into account in order to ensure effective and inclusive Peace Agreement implementation. Conflict victims can be strong advocates and change agents in their communities for reconciliation, peacebuilding and support of the Peace Agreement in their communities. "
"If we strengthen the skills and visibility of the Regional Youth Association (ASOJER) for promoting coexistence and constructive dialogue through music and culture; Then ASOJER youth member leaders will become change agents that help their communities and social organizations work more closely with government and open dialogue that helps pave the way for peace implementation; BecauseGovernment entities see the catalytic value of working with youth change agents to help open dialogue and increase receptivity for eventual peace implementation in conflict affected communities. Culture, music and dance can be costeffective means for opening dialogue in public spaces across lines of division in communities affected by conflict, like Saravena. ASOJER is wellrespected and recognized in Saravena among government and civil society stakeholders. "
"If we provide timely material and logistical support that enables ASOJUNTAS in Saravena to lead implementation of community center rehabilitation and ""Peace Encounters"" rapid response activities; Then We will help strengthen their positioning and credibility among their community members as strong peace agreement implementation and peacebuilding leaders at the community level; BecauseA window of opportunity exists to implement tangible rapid response activities at the community level in Saravena that demonstrate preparations for peaceASOJUNTAS and member Community Action Boards have a strong network in conflictaffected communities that can be activated and strengthened for peace implementation and peacebuilding, directly, and as a bridge between complex communities with influence of armed groups  and government.  Rapid response activities that combine tangible small infrastructure improvements with spaces and encounters for open dialogue among community members can be very effective for increasing credibility and trust in local community and government actors, increasing support for peace reducing divisions. "
"If the Arauca department and five key municipal governments can quickly and flexibly increase their technical capacity for project development through timely handson support; ThenThe Arauca department and five key municipal governments will be more capable of gaining credibility through leading projects and public investment in rapid response, readiness and peace agreement implementation in their communities. BecauseDepartment and municipal government effective project development skills and are critical for ensuring adequate funding for communitylevel investment for readiness, peace agreement implementation and responsiveness to community needs and expectations. Currently, the department and municipal governments in Arauca have low levels of capacity, which inhibits them from accessing new public investment for their respective communities, particularly during the critical window of opportunity prior and during peace agreement implementation for visible, small, rapid response projects. New skills and projects will help the department and municipal governments gain credibility with their community members. Security conditions in target communities permit the full implementation of the activity considering the ELN is initiating negotiations and the FARC are in the process of finalizing peace agreements. "
"If the Community Action Boards of Puerto Jordan and the municipal government conduct joint actions with common goals, such as improving the sports court for use of community members;  ThenThe Community Action Boards and the municipal government will increase stakeholder interactions, build new trust to overcome historical tensions and further territorial peacebuidling.  BecausePuerto Jordan is a geographic meeting point between the Filipinas and Bocas del Ele communities, which are strategic transitions zones for FARC demobilization and peace agreement preparation and implementation. The Tame municipal government has demonstrated interest in joint actions that can further territorial peacebuilding over the short term. Distrust between the Puerto Jordan JAC members internally, and with the municipal government of Tame has created a serious road block to furthering peacebuilding that must be addressed. Puerto Jordan JAC members have expressed willingness to participate and lead peacebuilding activities with government stakeholders. The peace process with the ELN continues to advance without major security impacts in Arauca, and the FARC agreement continues with the bilaterial ceasefire while the critical referendum phase is completed. "
"If we help the Arauca department government promote and prepare youth leaders as change agents for peace implementation and citizenship; ThenYouth leaders will help Arauca deparment government by playing a key role as change agents that encourage preparation and participation in peace implementation; BecauseThe governor of Arauca has requested quick support to help increase youth participation and leadership for peace implementation. There is already an existing cadre of youth leaders with high potential in Arauca that are working individually  with the diploma course they will gain new skills, share experiences and take on new tools to increase the reach and impact of their work. Youth leaders who participate in high quality, dynamic and practical diploma courses become better equipped to lead in their communities for peace implementation. "
"If we promote the Arauca Women´s Network leadership and establish safe spaces for open dialogue with Tame municipal government ThenWe will enable women leaders of the Arauca Women´s Network to take on clear roles as community change agents in support of peace agreement preparation and implementation. BecauseWomen´s organization members in Tame and the region are committed and interested in becoming change agents and taking on leadership roles for the preparation and implementation of the peace agreement. Women´s organization members are interested in working with municipal government to increase their influence and participation in peace and conflict mediation initiatives. Women´s organizations in Arauca lack the training and safe space to carlify and take on their leadership roles for peace. Tame municipal, Arauca department and national government entities are keen on providing strategic and timely support to women to increase their participation and protagonism in peace at the territorial level.  "
"If we provide strategic logistical and material support for organization of soccer championships as a means to increase interaction, trust and joint work between Community Action Board members from urban neighborhoods of Tame; ThenWe will help the Association of JACs, JAC members and Tame municipal government officials trust each other, interact and work together for territorial peace implementation preparation. BecauseASOJUNTAS is facing the critical need to strengthen it´s JAC member mobilization and participation in community preparations for peace. There is a lack of trust, interaction and joint work between the Asociation of JACs, JAC members including youth leaders and municipal government officials  especially focused on preparations for peace implementation. It is important to engage and youth for JAC and peace preparations through incentives and attractive mobilization strategies  like soccer  that build on existing spaces for interaction and conversation. The Tame municipal government needs an effective means of mobilizing new JAC membership and community participation. "
"IfIndigenous youth and members of different social organizations from diverse ideologies (A3J, ASOJER and ASCATIDAR) from the municipality of Arauquita can open dialogue about the points of the peace agreements and their implementation in the territory;ThenYouth and social organization leaders will be able to overcome their ideological differences and tensions thereby developing a common vision together regarding the peace agreements and their leadership in implementation in the territories. BecauseUsing widereaching communications platforms such as community radio are proven mechanisms for enabling dialogue between stakeholders. Engaging youth from different ethnic groups and ideological backgrounds, and giving them a constructive outlet to express their views are crucial for reducing tensions, overcoming entrenched positions, and reaching new understanding together regarding their joint roles in leading peace. Instead of only carryingout face to face dialogue, using community radio will serve as a catalyst for expanding impact of the dialogues to listeners across the Arauca department and the region  making visible an important example for other communities affected by conflict and with opposing ideological backgrounds. The indigenous youth and social organization members have expressed excitement and interest in participation in new radio and communications activities. "
"If we create strategic opportunities to strengthen the credibility of the Arauquita municipal government among its citizens through tangible actions that demonstrate responsiveness and benefits;  ThenWe will improve trust and positive collaboration for agreement implementation and territorial peacebuilding between the Arauquita municipal government and its citizens, particularly influential civil society groups and change agents such as the Committee on Human Rights, Farmers Association, A3J.BecauseCivil society groups in Arauquita are skeptical and perceive that the municipal government has not taken on a leadership role in their communities for peace agreement implementation preparations and territorial peacebuilding. The civil society group leaders influence community perceptions and priorities and are therefore key for helping to bridge the division and transform mistrust and credibility problems with Arauquita municipal government. Civil society group leaders and Arauquita municipal government officials are interested in joint actions together, but lack the immediate resources and operational capacity. Arauquita is a critical zone for reaching remote rural communities and bringing them on board together with government as lack of constructive engagement and opportunities for building trust could create road blocks for peace. "
"If we help expand the rapid response capabilities of the Saravena Ombudsman´s office; ThenThe Saravena Ombudsman´s office will more effectively respond to conflict victim and other citizen needs, thereby improving credibility in government and territorial peace. BecauseSaravena Ombudsmen are interested and have prioritized expanding their coverage and services in the five municipalities it covers, which have been gravely affected by the armed conflict. The majority of conflict victims and other citizens in these rural communities feel that their rights, protection and conflict mediation needs are unmet and they are unclear about the role and services that the Ombudsman´s office provides and how it relates to peace implementation. These conflict victims and citizens feel abandoned by government, with high levels of distrust and lack of confidence that concrete changes will happen in their communities as a result of peace implementation. It is important to position the Public Ministry and its role in ARA and key municipalities in establishing, strengthening, expanding government presence and services that help to address critical needs regarding justice, rights, protection and conflict during the transition to peace. "
"If the Community Action Board (JAC) in Bajo Cusay II and the municipal administration carry out joint actions with common goals, such as the improvement of the sports fields and the urban environment, for the community  of Botalon.Then,There will be a new key partner and change agent, Community Action Board (JAC) in the Botalon region, who will contribute firsthand to the benefits of the peace accords and thus increase the credibility of the municipal administration in the eyes of the civilian populationBecause,Bajo Cusay II is a meeting point between the communities of the region of Botalon, which needs to prepare for peace agreement implementation.There is distrust between Community ActionBoard (JAC)  in the community and the municipal administration, which has negatively affected its effectiveness in fulfilling its mission as a social organization.There is an interest on the part of Tame's municipality in coordinating actions that promote territorial peacebuilding."
"If The Saravena municipal government leads quick response actions focused on the inclusion of small producers, within the framework of the preparation of the municipality for the construction of territorial peace.ThenThe rural population of Saravena, in particular the small agricultural producers will begin to generate bonds of confidence with the local administration and will be involved in processes of construction of peace in the municipalityBecauseSmall producers have not been sufficiently supported by municipal administrations in their production, marketing and exchange activities. Saravena municipal government has prioritized actions to support small producers as part of it´s institutional approach to expanding its presence and increasing credibility with rural communities. Saravena municipal government must take advantage of the window of opportunity to respond to the expectations and skepticism of small producers and other rural community stakeholders to demonstrate tangible peace benefits  if not, credibility and trust will decline making future work implementing postconflict initiatives extremely difficult. It is important to continue building a common understanding of peacebuilding as a joint venture with coresponsibilities between government AND communities. The security situation and the ELN peace process continue to advance and activities aren´t adversely affected. "
"If the Saravena municipal government implements rapid response actions focused on the protection of rural educational environments in preparation for the territorial peacebuilding process in the municipality.Then,Rural Saravena's population, particularly the children's families and adolescents victims of forced displacement, will have increased confidence and trust in the local administration, and interest in participating in the activities led by Saravena Mayor's Office will be encouraged.BecauseIn the region there is a high rate of victim population and child recruitment.The rural population does not currently trust the Saravena municipal government.‘Colombia Transforma' will make inroads into the community around the school that can be leveraged in future activities.It will motivate the rural community benefited to participate in activities led by the Saravena municipal government."
"IfYoung people and community leaders participate in informational spaces, engage in dialogue, and reflect on the points of the peace agreements and their implementation in the territory.Then, They will have more tools to define their role, understand the role of other actors, and act as agents of change in the implementation of agreements in the department of Arauca.Because,  Through the participation of young people from various youth groups and community leaders, a mutual recognition will be given, which would mean a first effort for future joint work in the processes of territorial peace.  There is an interest on the part of young people to participate jointly in communication activities, regardless of their ideology.  There is little information on peace agreements and therefore on the role that youth and community leaders can play in the implementation of these agreements.  Youth and community leaders are conducive to momentous changes in the development of regions"
"If We support department government to create an audiovisual arts school and execute public film forums focused on territorial peacebuilding with youth leaders; ThenWe will help to catalyze new creative opportunities for youth to take on leadership roles in territorial peacebuilding in their municipalities and avoid risks  of violence; Because Youth are attracted to innovative and creative means of public expression and leadership regarding their roles in territorial peacebuilding.Without such opportunities, youth from these critical conflictaffected communities are not actively engaging in peacebuilding issues or implementation, making them suceptible to risks of involvement in illegal activities and violence during the transition. The Arauca department government and it´s youth initiatives program are keen on promoting new creative methodologies that are attractive to youth and that can spark their interest in their roles as leaders and change agents in territorial peace. The actividad provides a new opportunity for Colombia Transforma to connect with new civil society leaders and youth with whom the program has yet to have contact. "
"If we help to generate public safe spaces to bring together Arauquita municipal officials, social organizations and community members; ThenOpportunities for collaboration between these stakeholders will increase and they will be able to reflect and act on the peace agreements and their roles and implications in their territory. Because Arauquita is a strategic municipality for national government to garner support for the FARC peace agreement and the nascent peace process with the ELN. Arauquita has diverse social organizations with different political ideologies and visions who need safe spaces to connect, overcome their differences and to begin working together focused on the common goal of peace in their territory. Arauquita is in dire need of quick, visible and effective activities that help to build trust and overcome the traumas of armed conflict and the division created between the war between the FARC and ELN groups. Enabling safe public spaces for interaction between government and community stakeholders is proven to be an effective strategy for furthering trustbuilding and local commitments to taking on joint roles for peace. The security situation in Arauquita remains stable and civil society leaders have sufficient proctection. "
"If the National Government, led by the Directorate of Territorial Management and the Municipality of Arauquita, initiates rapid response actions that benefit communities in Filipinas.Then,Inhabitants of that community will have increased trust in the National Government their interest in participating in the implementation of the agreements and territorial peacebuilding will increase.BecauseFilipinas has been identified as a possible concentration area for the FARCEP, and the National Government needs to have an institutional presence.Filipinas is a strategic region for the National Government to carry out territorial peacebuilding actions, due to its influence and presence of illegal armed groups.The inhabitants of this rural area have expressed that these types of actions are motivating factors to coordinate activities for the benefit of the communities."
"If we support the Tame municipal government complete remodeling and improvements to the Agricultural Technical Institute (IPA) in the rural town of Puerto Jordan. Then We will help enable the Tame municipal government to lead a rapid response action to improve rural agricultural education services to conflictaffected communities as part of Havana peace agreement implementation. BecauseGovernment and community leaders feel strongly that improvements to the IPA is a critical need that must be addressed in order to provide improved rural agricultural education services for youth who can become change agents for territorial peacebuilding. The initial improvements made by the department and Tame municipal governments must be quickly completed in order to ""win back"" community trust and credibility of government. The communities surrounding the ZVTNs, including Puerto Jordan, feel that benefits of Havana peace agreement implementation are going primarily to the ZVTNs and not to their needs. They are eager to see tangible peace benefits in their communities too. "
"If the technical and operational capacities of the Tame Obudsman (Personeria) for victims and other citizen assistance is improved; ThenThe 14 rural communities of Tame municipality that neighbor de FARC concentration zones (ZVTN Filipinas) will see and benefit from the increased government presence and responsiveness to victim and citizen needs during initial peace agreement implementation. Because It is critical for government, especially the Obudsmen, quickly and visibly expand their presence and services in communities neighboring the FARC concentration zones in order to demonstrate that initial peace agreement implementation at the communitylevel directly benefits them  not only demobilizing guerrilla members. The expanded tecnical and operation capacity for service provision is critical for demonstrating to conflict victims and citizens that the peace agreement is beginning to be implemented, that it is credible, and that it will benefit them directly with access to government services. In rural communities of Tame there are large concentrations of conflict victims who have yet to access government assistance services. There are also new protection and human rights violations threats community members, especially leaders, are facing during the initial implementation of the peace agreement as FARC members congregate and leave power vacuums. It is important to coordinate the work of the Ombudsmen in key municipalities such as Tame, with other Obudsmen in Arauca (ej Saravena), as well as with the National Federation of Personeros (FENALPER) to align national, regional and local priorities and stragies during peace implementation. "
"If the technical and operational capacities of the Fortul Obudsman (Personeria) for victims and other citizen assistance is improved; ThenThe 25 rural communities of Fortul municipality will perceive and benefit from the increased government presence and responsiveness to victim and citizen needs during initial peace agreement implementation. BecauseIt is critical for government, especially the Obudsmen, quickly and visibly expand their presence and services in critical communities to demonstrate that initial peace agreement implementation at the communitylevel directly benefits them (not only demobilizing guerrilla members). The expanded tecnical and operation capacity for service provision is critical for demonstrating to conflict victims and citizens that the peace agreement is beginning to be implemented, that it is credible, and that it will benefit them directly with access to government services. In rural communities of Fortul there are large concentrations of conflict victims who have yet to access government assistance services. There are also new protection and human rights violations threats to community members, especially leaders, are facing during the initial implementation of the peace agreement.It is important to coordinate the work of the Ombudsmen in key municipalities such as Fortul, with other Obudsmen in Arauca (ej Saravena, Tame), as well as with the National Federation of Personeros (FENALPER) to align national, regional and local priorities and stragies during peace implementation. "
"If the UARIV, department, Arauquita and Tame municipal governments develop displaced person return and relocation plans together; ThenIt will be possible to take the first steps for Havana peace agreement implementation in Arauquita and Tame regarding displaced conflict victim return and relocation thereby demonstrating tangible peace benefits and institutional commitments. BecauseThere is a critical lack of coordination and planning between the UARIV and Arauca governments for displaced conflict victim return and relocation that is preventing Havana agreement implementation. Join plans with specific methods, timelines and roles are an effective means to ensure institutional coordination and effectiveness. Development and implementation of the return and relocation plans are a concrete means for helping to connect the conflict victim population with other government services and programs. Further delays in planning and implementing the assistance will continue to create new tensions and frustrations among the population. "
"If the Arauca department and municipal governments, JACs and community members rehabilitate public parks together;  ThenGovernment will gain credibility, collaboration will increase and community members will see tangible evidence that peace implementation benefits are reaching the territories. BecauseThere is a new opportunity to link results of previous activities working with JACs and communities in preparations for peace agreement implementation to now expand and involve department government.  Participation of the JACs is a strategic way to catalyze increased community member and leader participation and link with municipal government. Tangible rapid response activities involving different levels of government, JACs and community members have been proven to build credibility and improve citizen perceptions during transitions to peace. "
"If we provide the Arauquita Ombudsman timely professional support, logistics support, and office equipment that enables its team to provide rapid response services to 20 priority rural communities; ThenWe can help visibly demonstrate the responsiveness and presence of the Arauquita Ombudsman in providing vital government services to conflict victims near the ZVTNs during initial peace agreement implementation. BecauseThe Arauquita Ombudsmen must play an important role in priority rural communities expanding government services as part of peace agreement implementation; However, it currently does not have the means to address technical and operational capacity shortcomings to expand it´s coverage to meet demand and community expectations. Quickly expanding Ombudsman services and presence in 20 priority communities can help to generate new credibility and trust between citizens and government, which is crucial during the first months of agreement implementation. "
"If we help create and train 10 women´s leadership committees from 10 neighborhoods and rehabilitate the Women´s Center buildingThenWe will expand women´s leadership and Women´s Center services into rural neighborhoods prioritized for peacebuilding and agreement implementation. BecauseInitial peacebuilding and agreement implementation in Arauca lacks organized inclusion of women leaders and women´s groups. Women leaders in the 10 priority target neighborhoods are motivated and keen to participate in the training sessions and Women´s Center rehabilitation,  allowing them to expand their services and play more organized, effective and visible roles in peacebuilding and agreement implementation. Arauca municipal government has identified the need for implementing rapid response activities with women´s groups that provide tangible benefits (services) and opportunities for leadership and participation. "
"If the Saravena municipal government gains new access to communities and stakeholders (JACs, youth, citizens) affected by armed conflict through sports facilities rehabilitation rapid response; ThenThe Saravena municipal government, and government in general, will gain new confidence and credibility among the rural population that are key for peacebuilding and agreement implementation.  BecauseTangible activities that are quickly implemented with community participation and provide collective benefit are  effective means for building trust and confidence in conflictaffected zones. Saravena and target community members have high expectations that the municipal government will followthrough with tangible peace benefits. Infrastructure already exists, it just needs small investments for rehabilitation, making this activity costeffective / able to produce results with minimal investment. There are political and ideological gaps between Saravena municipal government and the communities that must be bridged in order to make progress towards peace. "
"If We support the Tame municipal conciliation center by strengthening office services and conciliator capacity regarding their roles in peace agreement implementation; ThenTame municipality conciliators will have the office conditions, knowledge and tools about their roles in peace agreement implementation to improve their alternative dispute resolution services in priority communities, including near ZVTNs. BecauseConciliators have voiced they needs for access to retraining, knowledge, tools and improved office conditions to improve their services and role in peace agreement implementation in critical rural communities. Conciliators have been identified and prioritized by national government (e.g. ACP, Justice) to faciliate rapid response access to conciliation and justice services in rural areas.Conciliators play an important role identifying and mitigating tensions and community conflicts in critical zones near the ZVTNs. "
"SiLos líderes entre las Asociaciones indígenas ASOCATA y ASCATIDAR participan en un espacio propiciado por la Oficina de Asuntos Étnicos del Ministerio del Interior, como los Juegos Tradicionales indígenas. EntoncesSe podrá generar un acercamiento entre los líderes de ASOCATA y ASCATIDAR que históricamente han estado distanciado,. Porque La desconfianza entre líderes de las organizaciones indígenas ha afectado negativamente su desempeño como actores que representan sus pueblos y por ende, su capacidad de credibilidad y confianza para liderar acciones que apoyan la implementacion de los acuerdos.  El Ministerio del Interior ha manifestado la voluntad de participar y liderar espacios que promuevan y preparen su territorio para la implementación del Acuerdo de Paz.  La implementación de los acuerdos de paz implica un ejercicio más activo del liderazgo por parte de los lideres y sus comunidades indigenas, sin el cual pueden quedar sin representación y participación. "
"If we quickly support the adaptation of the center for the milk collection of the APAMASO producers association; ThenThe APAMASO producers association will be empowered as change agents for rapid response actions with government (municipal, ART) related to licit livelihoods and peace agreement implementation. BecauseIt is necessary to demonstrate visible rapid response benefits of peace agreement implementation led by government and stakeholders to generate trust and credibility.APAMASO is ready and committed to taking new actions that help them leave behind illicit crop cultivation and forge viable dairy production livelihoods.Rapid, focused support for APAMASO will be an ""early victory"" for taking first steps of peace agreement implementation regarding point 1 and agricultural livelihoods in this strategic community. "
"If we provide key training and material support to members of the Tame Regional Committee of CattleRanchers (RCCR); ThenIt will make visible the tangible benefits of territorial peace agreement implementation, licit livelihoods and leadership of a change agent that is respected by the communities. BecauseThe RCCR already has members and presence throughout Tame Municipality, including communities in strategic zones near the ZVTN. The RCCR members have already worked closely with the national government on the subsititution of illicit coca crops, providing an excellent example of viable livelihoods. The RCCR members are still very skeptical regarding the Havana peace agreement, as they have yet to see direct tangible benefits. Rapid response actions with the RCCR that are practical and will demonstrate quick results, which helps to engage member active participation on future peace agreement implementationrelated activities.  "
"If we support implementation of Fortul municipal government´s program ""Government in the Street"" in seven districts;ThenIt will access strategic rural areas demonstrating to communities the arrival of tangible institutional support as part of rapid response and peacebuilding efforts. BecauseRapid response activities led by the municipal government are effective means to gain access and position institutions with the population for postconflict. Communities in the seven target districts have high levels of mistrust of municipal govenment and engaging the JACs and civil society organizations will help to create new bonds of trust. Lack of quick government action and presence in these strategic districts may cause continued disenfrachisement and frustrations among community members. "
"If we make possible the training of 100 leaders on the final Havana Peace Agreement, territorial peacebuilding and community projects for rural communities in Tame and Arauquita; ThenWe will provide information and skills that will empower rural leaders to become change agents for territorial peacebuilding in rural Arauquita and Tame municipalities neighboring the ZVTNs. Because Community leaders do not currently have access to opportunities to become actively involved in peacebuilding in their communities.  There are tensions and problems related to lack of clear information and opportunities for community participation led by rural leaders near the      ZVTN and critical communities for agreement implementation. Creating new opportunities for rural leaders to be empowered and catalyze visible actions with key partners such as the Pastoral are proven means    to prepare rural community members to be effective leaders in the future for agreement implementation and territorial peacebuilding.

"Si Se elaboran los estudios y diseños y el levantamiento catastral en el centro poblado de Puerto Jordán, municipio de Tame;EntoncesSerá completado el proceso de legalización, catastro y planeación urbana, con el liderazgo de la Alcaldía de Tame. PorqueEsto va a permitir que la población legalice sus predios y así facilitar el acceso a servicios institucionales en Puerto Jordán.El centro poblado de Puerto Jordán hace parte de las veredas vecinas a la ZVTN y va ser el punto de atención institucional en la implementación de los    Acuerdos de Paz para que las comunidades vecinas también se sienten los beneficios de los acuerdos. Es una prioridad y puede ser una respuesta rápida del Gobierno Nacional antes estas comunidades."
"Si  Se construyen las cuatro obras de arte (box culvert) como parte del mejoramiento de la vía Filipinas Bocas de EleEntonces,Se mejorará las vías de acceso y conectividad para los corregimientos de Filipinas y Bocas del Ele Municipio de Arauquita Porque  Las comunidades evidenciarán los beneficios de los Acuerdos de Paz.  Filipinas y Bocas del Ele hacen parte del corredor circundante a la ZVTN y va ser el punto de atención institucional en la implementación de los Acuerdos de Paz.   Con la obra se contribuye a mejorar las condiciones socioeconómicas de la región, incrementando el flujo de comercio y de servicios de las comunidades  Se trata de un corredor estratégico para la Fuerza Pública, debido a que esta zona es clave para el control del territorio y soberanía."
"IfArauquita municipal government, in coordination with the Agency for Territorial Renewal (ART) builds a vehicle bridge over the Caranal River on the ArauquitaPanama highway in Arauca.ThenIt will improve the connectivity and the relationship between the Arauquita municipal government and remote, underserved, rural communities, as part of the peace agreement rapid response strategy BecauseBridge construction work in remote zones is an effective strategy for helping to increase the flow of trade and services between communities and for demonstrating tangible peace agreement benefits. Arauquita municipal government is interested and committed to expanding its presence and services to the most remote communities. Opening access to the remote communities will help institutions to increase their presence and offer alternatives to illicit economies.  "
"If the infrastructure and facilities of the National Learning Service (SENA) in Saravena are improved; Then We can help increase the quality and reach of SENA vocational education services for youth from Saravena conflictaffected communities as part of ""Plan 100"". BecauseSENA is national government entity that has been tasked with implementing rapid response rural vocational educational courses to strengthen conflictaffected communities and build trust in the Havana peace agreement as part part of ""Plan 100"".SENA in Saravena is the Institution with the greatest credibility in terms of education in rural areas.The rural population does not have the resources to access technical education services and SENA is the only institution with free education services."
"If we provide training on handicrafts, entrepreneurship and software for common office and administrative use to members of the Association of Araucanian Women Workers (AMAR.T) in Arauquita, Fortul and Tame municipalities. Then,Women's committees of the Association of Araucanian Women Workers (AMAR.T) will increase their knowledge of office software and entrepreneurship, providing them with opportunities in microenterprise.Because,AMAR.T works with women in rural areas close to ZVTN, which would allow peace actionsIt is important to promote reconciliation processes through change agents such as women in order to be involved on the implementation of the Peace Agreement at the local levelAMAR.T considers peace as a reconstruction between the different actors that were involved during the conflict "
"If we provide small infrastructure remodeling support for the Antonio Ricaute rural school, in the priority community of Corocito;ThenWe will help enable government and the Antonio Ricaute rural school to provide improved educational services to youth in underserved rural areas of Corocito community.BecauseRapid tangible actions led by government in this key community can help to mitigate possible tensions that could affect support for the ELN peace process, or support for the FARC peace agreement implementation. Corocito has been prioritized by the national government including the OHCP and Arauca department and municipal governments as it has been the epicenter of armed conflict impacts on the civilian population. Involving the rural school stakeholders, including teachers, parents, students and community leaders will help to motivate participation in other peace implementation activities in the future led by Tame municipal government. "
"If we help improve the Arauca Ombudsman (Defensoria) Office infrastructure and organize 10 service fairs; ThenThe Arauca Ombudsman Office human rights and reparations services will be expanded in ZVTN neighboring communities as a strategy to provide equitable access to rights and peace benefits. BecauseThe Arauca Ombudsman Office has identified the need to strengthen its presence near communities surrounding the ZVTN through the provision of services, rights and reparations monitoring and followup  as outlined in the Havana peace agreement. Community members in ZVTNneighboring communities want to see more robust support soon as they feel the focus of peace benefits to date are only concentrated on supporting the ZVTN and the FARC reintegration process. "
"If the OHCP implements a diploma course ""Leadership School"" for local leaders in Arauca, Arauquita, Fortul and Tame municipalitiesThenIt will promote local social leader participation through constructive dialogues on issues of territorial peace and the implementation of the peace accordsBecauseThe OHCP has identified the critical need to rollout communitylevel participatory peace leadership education to ensure mobilization and engagement of diverse civil society and social organizaiton sections in order to strengthen peace agreement implementation, reduce tensions and align narratives.Local leaders and community change agents have voiced needs for practical communitylevel tools and education that will support and expand their peacebuilding work and help to engage them with the OHCP. The OHCP is developing the methodology but lacks the funding and logistical support to implement it, which left undone will cause the OHCP to miss a critical window of opportunity for consolidating community peace leader engagement during the first phase of agreement implementation. "
If we help catalyze government design and iimplementation of the initial phase of the Integrated Health  MIAS program;ThenWe will promote community empowerment and participation in local oversight of government rapid response programs for rural health service delivery.BecauseCommunities are unaware of the processes of participation and monitoring because they are limited by political and social organizations.The design and implementation of the Integrated Health MIAS provides an excellent opportunity to engage and empower community members in program oversight.MIAS provides en opportunity for communities to feel that government is listening to them and that tangible rapid response services linked to peace are reaching their communities. 
"If the Association Of Community Action Boards (JAC) of Tame updates and disseminates their statutes using inclusive participation of its members; ThenWe will help ensure Tame JACs have updated and unified statutes so they can improve their governance and reduce tensions with civil society stakeholders. BecauseProblems of tensions and conflicts have arisen in rural communities near the ZVTN Filipinas between civil society leaders (many of whom are JAC representatives and members). Currently the JACs lack statutes to structure their governance and clarity of roles at the community level with their members and communities. The JAC representatives are strategic actors in these communities who can play a key role in conflict resolution and bringing together communities with tensions. If they do not take on this role, conflicts and tensions threaten peace agreement implementation progress near the ZVTN in Tame. "
"SiASONET capacita a 21 Consejos Comunitarios (421 personas) del Departamento de Arauca en el capítulo étnico del acuerdo final de la Habana;EntoncesLos 21 Consejos Comunitarios podrán generar un plan de acción que incluya los conocimientos aprendidos por el capítulo étnico del acuerdo final y definir su rol como comunidades AfroColombianas en la implementación de los acuerdos.Porque Las Consejos Comunitarios AfroColombianos en Arauca no conocen el componente étnico de los acuerdos de la Habana para poder definir sus   roles y poder participar.

A reliable power supply will help local leaders continue to focus on responding to citizens' needs and providing effective, consistent service delivery."
"OTI/ASIS assumes that a reliable electricity supply for the district government building is conducive to good governance. The government was traditionally viewed by the population as ineffective and incapable of delivering services. This opinion has changed through the presence of an operational government team at the district level and these gains must now be maintained. A poorly functioning district center, operating without power, would undermine the image of a responsible government that earlier activities have helped build."
"Assumption 1: Engaging the insular, uncooperative and disengaged communities in the Arghandab River Valley, connecting them to each other and district government, is key to the stability of the region. Assumption 2: By conducting shuras, meals, celebrations and other public gatherings in these areas, the District Governor will foster better relationships among the villages and between the villages and district government.Assumption 3: Creating connections among disengaged villages and district government will improve positive perceptions of GIRoA and help unify the district."

"ASI engagement with the Arghandab District Governor and Arghandab village elders led to the identification of a protection wall construction with the assumption that this infrastructure development project will strengthen linkages between GIRoA and local communities, and that these linkages are best demonstrated through tangible activities that they are responsive to community needs.

"If SSI supports the Dinsoor District administration and Dinsoor civil society groups in bolstering its capacity through training on good governance and leadership, and better coordination with civil society, women and youth groups as well as community mobilization, then the district administration's and civil society's capacity to be responsive to the needs of the community will increase, because the assumption is that the lack of skills to govern properly is inhibiting more effective responsiveness from the district administration and local community leaders."
"If SSI supports Diinsoor District administration in bolstering its capacity through provision of office furniture and equipment, then the district administration's capacity to be responsive to the needs of its constituents will be enhanced because one main contributing reason for the lack of effectiveness of the local administration is their lack of equipment to conduct the business of government. "
"If SSI supports Waaberi and Howlwadaag Primary Schools in bolstering their capacity to improve provision of education through procuring furniture, school materials, solar lanterns, sports kits and sanitation tools, then more children will enroll in the school due to parents having more confidence in the school and government because one main contributing reason for the lack of enrollment in the schools is the lack of confidence in the education system and poor physical state of the schools "
"If cultural engagements, such as traditional archery, are revived for the youth and elderly, then there will be less appeal to join Al Shaabab for the youth, because more increased interactions between youth and positive role models, who can mentor and educate them on Somali identity, can help deter them from AS influence."
"If youth participate in constructive activities and interactions alongside one another, then these youth will develop networks and share ideas for countering youth challenges in their communities that will help resist the lure of extremism and promote peace, because improved positive social networks and community association decrease the attraction of youth to clan and extremist groups. "
"If solar streetlights are installed along the main road in Diinsoor (action), then the community will be able to move freely for longer hours during the evening (outcome) and this will create a greater sense of normalcy and safety (impact), as poorly lit streets often hamper security (assumption)."
"If Dalbile supports the government in rehabilitating the Diinsoor Community Centre, then community members and the government will have a safe, public and free space to organise interactive events and meetings, because lack of safe public space hinders increased interaction and the opportunity to improve relations."
"If Wanleweyne women leaders are empowered through dialogue, networking and confidence building sessions, then they will improve their ability to access their local political structures because one reason for a lack of women's participation in the political sphere is a lack of selfconfidence that they can and should be allowed to access this traditionally maledominated system. "
"If we support participatory theater across towns in Afgoye District, then we can bring divided communities together to focus on what unites them, because communities, particularly marginalized groups, do not have enough opportunities to come together to talk about their issues in a peaceful and interactive way. "
"If Dalbile supports regional government efforts to engage religious leaders and traditional elders in conflict management and prevention, then the religious and traditional leaders will promote tolerance and peaceful coexistence among different groups because the religious and traditional leaders play an important role in Somali society, commanding influence and respect. "
"If Dalbile supports efforts to revive cultural activities such as the Istunka among the communities living in Afgoye, then the communities will have social platforms to enhance their peaceful coexistence because the lack of cultural activities is denying them the social space to build bridges.   "
"If Dalbile supports the youth of Diinsoor to participate in sporting activities, then the youth will commence positive social interaction that will enhance youth resilience to destabilizing forces because youth have limited opportunities to develop networks and engage with one another."
"If Dalbile supports the youth of South West State (SWS) to participate in sporting activities and interactions alongside one another, then these youth will establish positive social cohesion that will enhance community resilience to destabilizing forces because soccer will give them a chance to develop networks and share ideas."
If Dalbile conducts a peace awareness campaign including interactive activities between the government and host community then the interaction between community and government around  peace & social coexistence will increase because lack of access and interaction with the government is a source of distrust which feeds the community tensions.
"If Dalbile supports the sports tournament and dialogues between rural and urban youth in Wanlewayne, then there will be increased interaction between the rural and urban youth in Wanlewayne, because it is assumned that the increased interaction will build communication bridges a significant factor in breaking social barriers."
"If Dalbile provides office furniture and equipment to the Wanleweyn District administration, then the district administration's capacity to be responsive to the needs of its constituents will be enhanced because one main contributing reason for the lack of effectiveness of the local administration is their lack of equipment to conduct the business of government. "
"If SSI provides furniture, school learning materials, sports kits and sanitation tools, Sanitary pads  as well as government engagement events to bring together the community and the government, then this will improve perception of the government's ability to respond/provide services to its constituents becausethe school lacks these basic supplies and by so doing the government will be able to interact with the community"
"If the SWS Ministry of Information train state radio staff on journalistic and radio production topics, then the staff will have increased capacity to develop effective radio programming that will help to strengthen government's communication with their constituents, because the state radio does not have the capacity to develop interactive radio programming that appeals to citizens and spread messaging. "
"If mobile, returnee, displaced and host communities in mixed settlement settings are to engage in a five day dialogue session then this will improve relations that will lead to increased social integration and peaceful coexistence between the host community and returnees in Baidoa, because a lack of understanding and interaction hinders the opportunity to improve relations. "

If SSI installs 50 solar street lights in Qoryooley town then this will improve perceptions of public safety and improve citizens' perception that the government is responding to a community priority because security is a main concern in Qoryooley and the community expects the District and Regional Administration to provide security and street lights but the District Administration has no capacity to install solar street lights.
If SSI/Dalbile rehabilitates Qoryooley bridge and conducts an opening and handover ceremony then this will improve citizen's perception that the government is responding to a community need because the district administration currently doesn't have the financial capacity to rehabilitate the bridge. 
If the SWS Ministry of Information organizes and facilitates a five day government outreach week in Baidoa for 30 government ministries then this will increase community's awareness and knowledge of government functions and available services because there is lack of adequate interaction between SWS government and its citizens. 
"If a 5 day garbage collection and cleanliness campaign is conducted in Diinsoor district, then this will improve citizen's perception that their administration is responding to their needs of improving the environmental condition of Diinsoor because the high influx of IDPs in Diinsoor and lack of basic equipment and capacity of the local administration is hindering their response to a pressing needs identified by the community."
"If SSI provides SWS Ministry of Resettlement and Diaspora Affairs with office furniture, stationery and IT equipment and conducts a community event with 100 community members,  then the citizen's perception towards the Ministry's ability to respond towards the needs of its people will be improved because one main contributing reason for the lack of effectiveness of the local administration is their lack of adequate office space."
"If the Ministry of Women,Human rights and family affairs  implements activities to mark the International Women's Day in SWS and hold a threeday mobilization prior to the Day,then this will increase citizens' understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the SWS Ministry of Women and Gender and increase the advocacy skills of women leaders in SWS because the ministry lacks the capacity to allow women to have free and open space to  constructively engage with the ministry women in SWS and vice versa."
"If SSI provides SWS Ministry of Information and Social Awareness with rehabilitation office and furniture and IT equipment and conducts a community event, then the citizen's perception towards the Ministry's ability to engage with the community will be improved, because the Ministry currently works out of a temporary space and lacks office facilities,  equipment and furniture hindering the Ministry's ability to effectively deliver basic services to the people. "
"If Goof Gaduud Buurey Administration installs 50 poles of solar lights along 2km of  two roads (main road and hospital road), then this will increase the perception of government responding to a community need, because lack of streetlights is a community priority and citizens expect the administration to provide security and street lights but the local administration does not have the capacity and resources to install street lights."
"If SSI provides Goof Gaduud Buurey town administration with office furniture, equipment and stationery, THEN it will improve citizens perception of Goof Gaduud administration's ability to engage with the communityBECAUSEa)Lack of a functional office affects the administration's ability to effectively conduct the business of government since they are newly formed administration and they do not have resources to equip their offices.   b)The equipment supply will provide the administration with the tools to be a functioning administration and conduct governmental services."
"If SSI supports the SWS Drought Response Committee with three months media outreach, then this will improve citizens' perception of their government's ability to respond to an immediate priority and increase awareness of how to access assistance, because citizens' lack information about the government's support to the people affected by drought is an impediment to trust and confidence in their government."
"If the Goof Gaduud Administration offices are rehabilitated (painting walls, installing windows, doors, repairing/replacing roof), there is a perimeter wall constructed, and meeting hall constructed, along with a community event, then this will improve citizens' perception of the Goof Gaduud administration's ability to engage with the community because lack of prominent public space hinders accessibility of the community to the local administration offices limiting their engagement with the administration and knowledge on available service provision."
" If there is a joint OCHA and SWS Government drought assessment in three regions of SWS (including Xudur, Wajid, Ceel Barde, Berdale, Wanlaweyne, Diinsoor, Baraawe, Afgooye), then the Drought Committee and OCHA will have a better understanding of the effects of the drought in the Bay and Lower Shabelle regions and are able to target their interventions better, because the government response to the needs of the drought affected people is affected by the a) lack of access to rural populations under AS control b) lack of information on the extent and the needs of the affected population c) lack of adequate resources, financial and human resources and d) lack of technical capacity and expertise of the Government Drought Response Committees to conduct needs assessments"
"If SSI delivers and installs 100 water storage containers and provides hygiene kits to 1320 HH (approximately 7920 citizens) at 11 IDP communities around Baidoa, then citizens' perception will improve of their government's ability to respond to an immediate priority and increase safe water consumption because although inhabitants of the IDP camps are receiving water but lack water storage and good hygiene, causing the water to get contaminated therefore causing frustration among the community that the government is not responding to a pressing need."
"If SSI/Dalbile conduct a needs assessment of the Wanlaweyn Radio and holds a training for 17 radio staff on journalistic and radio production topics, THEN the staff will have increased capacity to develop effective radio programming that will help to strengthen District's communication with their constituents, BECAUSE the radio does not have the capacity to develop interactive radio programming that appeals to citizens and spread messaging."
"If SSI/Dalbile hosts  four youth gatherings with 135 participants during Iftar in Baidoa in collaboration with the local authorities, traditional and religious leaders and civil society organization, then this will increase interaction of youth with the local authorities, traditional and religious leaders and civil society organization in Baidoa, because lack of dialogue affects the administration's ability to effectively conduct the business of government and hear the needs of youth and community leaders and because the local officials are part of a newly formed administration and they do not have resources to organize dialogues to engage with the citizens. "
"If SSI/Dalbile hosts host four Iftar community gatherings with 57 participants during Iftar in Hudur in collaboration with the local authorities, traditional and religious leaders, and civil society organizations, THEN this will increase peaceful communitycommunity engagement between Hudur host community and communities from AlShabaab controlled areas such as Tieglow and Rabdhure currently living in Hudur, BECAUSE Hudur host community sees communities from AS controlled areas as a threat to the town's security and hence there is a lack of trust between the communities and because the regional governor sees the community gatherings as an opportunity to increase peaceful community to community engagement."
"If SSI/Dalbile hosts  four youth gatherings with 135 participants during Iftar in Diinsoor in collaboration with the local authorities, traditional and religious leaders and civil society organizations, then this will increase interaction of youth with the local authorities, traditional and religious leaders and civil society organization in Diinsoor, because lack of dialogue affects the administration's ability to effectively conduct the business of government and hear the needs of youth and community leaders and because the local officials are part of a newly formed administration and they do not have resources to organize dialogues to engage with the citizens.

"
"If SSI/Dalbile hosts four community gatherings during Iftar in collaboration with religious leaders, traditional leaders, women, youth and representatives of local government officials in Wanlaweyn, then this will increase interaction of youth with the local authorities, traditional and religious leaders and civil society organization in Wanlaweyn, because lack of dialogue affects the administration's ability to effectively conduct the business of government and hear the needs of youth and community leaders and because the local officials are part of a newly formed administration and they do not have resources to organize dialogues to engage with the citizens.

"Assumption & Theory of Change statement: This activity assumes that youth who are involved in  activities in their communities are more likely to be engaged in the civic life or decisionmaking process. This activity aims to reduce youth disengagement in the east, on the social and communal level, and distance them from tending to turn to violent ways of engagement."
"Youth were at the heart of the change of the February 2011 revolution in Libya, but are now detached on both the social and political level, tending to turn to violent ways of engagement. By providing Manga cartoons training and financial support to the talented outreach youth group, Creators, the Manga magazine will be a platform for young people involved in civic activities and engaging with other youth to promote messages of nonviolence and peaceful development."
"Theory of Change & Assumption Statement: Many in eastern Libya seek an end to the conflict and yearn for a Libya with civil institutions, but are confronted with national economic and ideological disputes countered by aggressive local media messaging that inflate the conflict. In order to mobilize the moderate middle, influential advocates for dialogue must communicate more effectively and audibly, enabling them to overcome those voices that promote violence as a solution to conflict. This requires strengthening the ability and number of activists who promote peaceful solutions (at the community level) to conflict. Through this activity LTI 2 will strengthen advocates for nonviolence and dialogue communicate more effectively and audibly.)"
"This activity assumes that by supporting the LRC other organizations and CSOs will be encouraged to resume their activities because Benghazi is at a stage to regain stability in areas where the fighting stopped. This sends a critical message that to the people of Eastern Libya that CSOs are becoming active again in Benghazi, signalling a return to postconflict normalcy and civic engagement."
"Theory of Change & Assumption Statement: If Libyan youth are provided alternatives to conflict and are given opportunities to engage in campaign that stress tolerance, good citizenship and peaceful coexistence than attitude will change overtime and they will seek peaceful ways to resolve disputes  and resist mobilization to conflict because the majority of Libyan youth are against being polarized and want to live in peace."
This activity assumes that reestablishing the Benghazi Recording Studio and providing it with equipment and materials to create and disseminate music focusing on themes of peace and national unity will foster public support for peace and national unity in Benghazi. This is because the lack of voices calling for peace and unified community have pushed community away from resorting to nonviolence alternatives.    
"This activity assumes that by supporting the functioning of the information center through restoring its VSAT connection to the internet, the center will serve to strengthen and consolidate CSO relationships, which will lead to improved collaboration and independent activity implementation without LTI's immediate support. This activity assumes a lack of collaboration between CSOs in and around Tazirbu is negatively affecting the role they could play in advocating for nonviolence."
This activity assumes that a better understanding of factors and dynamics that have contributed to the recent stabilization in some parts of Benghazi will provide the program with a sounds basis to develop better informed and more targeted programming in this area.

"Supporting positive interaction opportunities between IDPs and host community members through the organizing and broadcasting of the competitions and events will build a sense of solidarity, understanding, and shared condition between communities that will enhance perceptions of social stability to the general public. This assumes that a key cause of tension between IDP and host communities is a lack of opportunity for social interaction between them."
"If we assist Al Bayda municipal council with the delivery of a community improvement project and public outreach assistance, then we will increase the interaction between the council and the residents, because: Municipal council is willing to interact with residents and sees value in better communication Al Bayda residents want to have opportunities to communicate with the council A tangible and popular project is an effective way for municipal council to engage residents and begin communicating "
These activities assume that the ability of municipal councils to mobilize local residents and deliver highly visible communityengagement projects would strengthen their legitimacy among citizens and enable them to play more vital role in the governance process at the local level.
"The key assumption behind this activity is that community spaces and engaging events would provide positive opportunities and encourage greater interaction between different communities, thereby helping to restore a sense of social trust and cohesion. This is because the lack of opportunities for interaction between different towns and communities in Libya has been a driver of conflict between them. "
"If we provide support the Benghazi MC to implement this cleanup campaign and improve ongoing trash collection, then the MC will have an opportunity to increase interaction with Elkeesh residents and help them better understand the MC's role in basic services.Assumptions:(a) Benghazi residents care about the image of their city and they will participate in the cleanup campaign.(b)   The clean up campaign will increase the awarness of the residents about the existence of the Benghazi MC.

They will interact with volunteers and with residents through information campaign. This will create an opportunity for citizenMC interaction around one of the MC's core services. "
"If we provide SMC with support to implement this cleanup campaign and community awareness campaign in Shahat, then we will increase residents' confidence in the MC's ability to deliver basic services, because (a) SMC does not have enough resources to deliver basic services and to address critical community needs,(b) SMC wants to deliver basic services and to address community needs. (c) The trash problem is the most highly visible public problem in the city (many public demonstrations and MC directly asking for help)(d) Benghazi residents care about the image of their city and they will participate in the cleanup campaign.(e) The MC will be at the forefront of efforts to address this problem working with community volunteers.

"
"If we provide support the Shahat MC and Ministry of Education to rehabilitate restrooms in the 6 most needy schools in Shahat, then we can help the MC increase residents' confidence in their ability to provide services, because: Shahat MC wants to deliver services and build a relationship with their community The schools is one of the most important service delivery issues to address based on concerns citizenshave raised through public protests and the assessment of international organizations The grantee will mobilize community volunteers and students to have a role in the rehabilitation of schools, linking them to what the MC is doing The awareness and information campaign will reinforce both the MC and the MOE role "
" IF Bayda MC provides basic furnishings to priority, overcrowded public schools and conducts a public outreach and awareness campaign, THEN Bayda school students, parents, and families have increased awareness of the MC's ability to deliver basic services, BECAUSE: This is a highpriority need for many students and families in Bayda - especially the ones who will be direct affected by this activity. In the past year, many children have been turned away from schools in their area b/c of overcrowding or have had to seek space in other schools. Many of these have complained to the MC directly. The problem is particularly challenging for female students. We assume that Bayda MC providing these materials will allow overcrowded schools to accept more students.  We assume that the prioritization process for distributing these furnishings and supplies will be transparent, wellcommunicated, and accepted. MC  wants to help deliver services and build a relationship with their community, but they lack the sufficient resources. The target audience (families of students) lacks information about MC efforts to address critical public needs, and the public outreach campaign will be strong enough to address that issue. The schools rehabilitation is a highly visible project that all target beneficiaries will recognize and appreciate as a completed by the MC. "
"IF Bayda MC upgrades the Bayda Autism Center with new equipment and materials in cooperation with the local education office and conducts an awareness campaign about the initiative, THEN families and community members involved in the Autism Center have increased awareness of the MC's ability to deliver critical services BECAUSE: We assume the center is a critical priority for the families and community members involved given their investment of time and resources into the center. The MC's effort to invest in this center, which is a priority and source of pride for many community members, will demonstrate their ability to support critical local services.

The MC will lead a strong awareness and information campaign that will reinforce both the MC and the education office roles."
"IF Bayda MC and the local health office upgrades the Bayda Medical Center with a critical piece of equipment to improve health services and conduct an awareness campaign about the initiative, THEN Patients and their families who visit/ benefit from the Medical Center have increased awareness of the MC's ability to deliver critical services BECAUSE: We assume the medical center is a critical priority for the families and community members from the Bayda area and broader region given that so much of the population relies on it for public medical care.   The Badya MC wants to deliver support to this center because it is one of the few large public medical centers in Libya but lack the necessary financial resources. Providing this piece of equipment will be a quick win that will significantly improve medical care in the region. The MC will lead a strong awareness and information campaign that will reinforce both the MC and the health office roles."

The project is a critical priority for residents in the neighborhood."
"IF the Bayda MC upgrades the Bayda Center for the Blind with new equipment and materials in cooperation with the Local Education Office and Bayda Social Security Office and conducts a public awareness campaign about the initiative, THEN families and community members involved in the Bayda Center for the Blind will have increased awareness of the MC's ability to deliver critical services BECAUSE: We assume the center is a critical priority for the families and community members in Bayda. Blind students are some of the most vulnerable populations since the government can no longer provide services that address their particular needs. The MC's effort to invest in this center, which is a priority and source of pride for many community members, will demonstrate its ability to support critical local services. The Bayda MC has assessed needs at the center and wants to support it, but lacks the necessary financial resources. The Bayda MC will lead a strong public awareness campaign that will highlight the role of the MC, Bayda Social Security Office, and the Local Education Office as capable service providers."
"IF Qaminis Municipal Council restores functionality with provision of furniture and equipment to 9 schools in Magroon area and conducts a public awareness campaign about the refurbishment of schools, THEN the community will have more confidence in the municipal council's ability to lead participatory basic service delivery, BECAUSE:This is a highpriority need according to many students and families in Magroon. (The schools were heavily damaged and looted in the fighting.) We assume that the prioritization process for distributing these furnishings and supplies will be transparent, wellcommunicated, and accepted by the community. The media campaign will keep the people updated on the municipal council activities regarding this matter, in terms of furnishing and preparing the schools by MC."
"If NRTI provides technical assistance to the Borno state government in the area of a critical community need  agriculture  the government will have increased capacity to respond to the needs of IDPs in Maiduguri in a time of intense crisis. In turn, this will contribute to increased confidence in the government on behalf of communities throughout Borno who remember that the government helped them during a critical period of instability."

"If NRTI provides technical assistance to the Borno state government in the area of a critical community need  agriculture  and provides technical support in the development of new governmentsponsored activities, the Borno State Government will have increased capacity to respond to the needs of IDPs in Maiduguri in a time of intense crisis. In turn, this will contribute to increased confidence in the government on behalf of communities throughout Borno who remember that the government helped them during a critical period of instability."
"If the BOSG is able to effectively establish a training center to provide agricultural training courses to IDP farmers and rural women, then community perception of government responsiveness to citizens needs will improve because communities expect government to respond to the agricultural needs of IDPs and women in agrarian Borno state."
" If the BOSG is able to effectively establish a training center and recruit staff to provide agricultural training services to IDP farmers and urban women farmers, then citizens perception of government responsiveness to their needs will improve "
"If power supply is stable it will improve BRTC output and increase hours of radio transmission, reach more citizens with information and news to the citizens of Borno about government policies and programs and reduce rumormongering that makes communities vulnerable to misinformation"

"If NRTI provides technical assistance to the Borno State Government in the area of a critical community need  agriculture  the government will have increased capacity to respond to the needs of internally displaced persons in Borno state in a time of intense crisis. In turn, this will contribute to increased confidence in the government on behalf of communities throughout Borno who remember that the government helped them during a critical period of instability.  This assumes that agriculture remains a critical source of economic livelihood in Borno and that those engaged in NRTI programs will be able to transfer skills learned in these programs to home communities."
"By hiring a local consultant to coordinate the planned move of the Dandal Kura program to Borno state, the NRTI program will be able to more rapidly implement Dandal Kura operations in Borno state, particularly as the Dandal Kura program moves toward a 24hour live broadcast from Maiduguri.   This, in turn, will help attract a greater audience in the program's target areas, both for the Dandal Kura program, as well as future media interventions planned for the NRTI program.  This is based on assumptions that there is suitable program/office space, as well as electricity and internet connectivity for the Dandal Kura to operate from Borno; that there is a continuing demand in the northeast for additional media information, both over shortwave, FM radio and other sources of media; that by basing operations in Maiduguri, the Dandal Kura program can more effectively achieve program objectives; and that there is enough of an appetite for Kanuri language broadcasting that a 24hour broadcast could be sustained; and that the audience throughout Nigeria can be greatly expanded throughout the Hausa and Kanuri speaking regional population."
"If IDPs are provided with radios then their access to credible information in their local language about things happening beyond the walls of the camps will improve, thereby reducing perceptions of marginalization among the IDPs ecause radio is a valued source of information and the lack of access to radio sets is the primary barrier to this information."

"If the farmers groups, associations and cooperatives in Borno become better organized, they will participate more actively in the BRI program which will enable them to receive training and mentoring on how to improve their organization. This will enable the groups, associations and cooperatives to access productive services from government programs. By doing this we would have contributed to changing community perception that the Borno state government is being responsiveness to the farmers' priority needs, because these farmers expect government to respond to their livelihoods needs. This will ultimately relieve them of some stress, improve interaction with authorities and reduce frustration that fuels extremism. "
"If we provide radio equipment to the University of Maiduguri campus radio station, the program will be able to build a relationship with the University that will open doors to future activities to counter violent extremism in the state, because NRTI believes when we respond to critical needs of communities and organizations that will build trust with beneficiaries."
"If a trusted space is created for IDPs to discuss and openly communicate their current needs and concerns visàvis the BH insurgency and IDP crisis then tension and frustration among IDPs will be reduced because, with the improving security situation in Borno State, IDPs have recognized the absence of such platforms as a fundamental driver of their feeling of marginalization."
"If vocational training is provided to IDP youth in Maiduguri by Ramat Polytechnic, then the government will be able to demonstrate its efforts to address youth priority needs, because being unemployed and unproductive in their host communities has been a particular source of youth frustration with government."
"If a trusted space is created for IDPs to discuss and openly communicate their current needs and concerns visàvis the BH insurgency and IDP crisis then tension and frustration among IDPs will be reduced because, with the improving security situation in Borno State, IDPs have recognized the absence of such platforms as a fundamental driver of their feeling of marginalization."
"If classroom furniture is supplied to rehabilitated schools in Maiduguri Metropolitan and surrounding LGAs by the BOSUBEB, then the BOSG will be able to demonstrate its efforts to improve the education sector because reopening public schools has been identified as a community priority. "
"If two STTAs are engaged as BRI LGA Extension Agents in Biu and Hawul LGAs, the BOSG will demonstrate its efforts in improving economic opportunities for small farmers in these communities, contributing to improved perceptions of government responsiveness to community needs because the agriculture sector remains a critical source of economic livelihood in Borno and having a sustained BRI presence at the community level will build people's confidence that the BOSG is serious about its efforts."
"If BOSG provides seeds to returning IDPs in Kaga LGA then agricultural activities will increase because a lack of seeds for returning IDPs is a primary hurdle to taking advantage of the upcoming rain season, and most IDPs are peasant farmers. We also assume current security gains that make the area accessible will hold."
"If NRTI hires engineering firms to support the development of technical designs and specifications for smallscale infrastructure projects in Borno State then these projects will more effectively demonstrate government responsiveness to community expectations because engineering firms possess the widerange of technical expertise required to properly develop these activities. This is based on the assumption that support from engineering firms will reduce the timeline required to prepare these technical documents, which are currently prepared by the NRTI team which lacks requisite mix and diversity of engineering staff that the program requires."
"If the BOSG provides timely and sustained support to strengthen farmers cooperatives and various productive lines in Borno, then citizens will begin to have confidence in the Government's ability to support their critical needs, especially those related to agricultural activities, because lack of such timely support in the past has been a primary hurdle to enabling farmers to take full advantage of the rainy season and produce crops for household food security and income. This assumes that the current political will and commitment of the BOSG to support farmers' cooperatives will be sustained and that the current security gains that currently make the area accessible will continue to hold and not deteriorate."

"If we provide inkind assistance to address the capacity and logistics challenges of BSCAC and they are able to stage theater performances targeting the citizenry with messages of hope and tolerance in IDP camps and other locations in Maiduguri, then we will have supported them to counter the narratives of the insurgents and provide communities with constructive peace messages that address despair, anger and frustration. Because as the citizens commence postinsurgency life, strategic communications on the return to normalcy, along with factual and correct information about resisting insurgents ideology is a desired need. This coupled with BOSG proactively addressing other socioeconomic issues will significantly increase the peoples self esteem and confidence to resist violent extremists lures and ideas thereby reducing the citizens vulnerability to VE."
"If we provide inkind support to TBL to organize the formal public launch of Dandal Kura radio studio in Maiduguri, then we will have supported their formal establishment in their target community and will attract the support of peers in the media industry, government and public at large. This will continue to diminish the conditions that make BH able to thrive in northeast Nigeria."
"If we enhance the ability of BOSG to repurpose the exCivilian JTF members and raise community awareness on government reintegration efforts, then the communities will know and better appreciate CJTF reintegration by BOSG because exCJTF members may become threats to security and pose serious risk to community peace in the near future. By doing so we will have contributed significantly in improving the government responsiveness to citizens' expectations in the state."
"If BOSG can address the issue of expertise among media practitioners in Maiduguri in news gathering, content management and broadcast quality by providing capacity development in areas of identified gaps and emerging trends like the social media, then we will have supported improving media content that provides communities access to reliable news and information that addresses popular topics and perceptions of marginalization, because lack of timely access to factual and quality information is one of the factors driving BH and sympathy for insurgency in the NE. This coupled with BOSG being proactive to address other related issues will ultimately contribute to significantly reducing the perception of marginalization among the people in the NE Nigeria"
"If the Borno State Ministry of RRR rehabilitates Central Primary School in Chibok, then the BOSG will demonstrate its ability to respond to critical community needs, because primary education is a top community priority and the lack of public primary education facilities in Chibok has been a main hurdle to children returning to the classroom and consequently, a source of increasing community frustration with the government. This coupled with BOSG being proactive to address other related issues will increase community trust that the government is working for them in Chibok."
"If the Borno State Ministry of RRR rehabilitates Likama Primary School in Chibok, then the BOSG will demonstrate its ability to respond to critical community needs, because primary education is a top community priority and the lack of public primary education facilities in Chibok has been a main hurdle to children returning to the classroom and consequently, a source of increasing community frustration with the government. This coupled with BOSG being proactive to address other related issues will increase community trust that the government is working for them in Chibok."
"If the Ministry for Local Government and Emirates Affairs is able to distribute over 50MT of food assistance to 5000 IDPs in Madarari center according to the Sphere's international standards, then the BOSG will be able to demonstrate its efforts to improve the food security needs of these beneficiaries because recent assessments and reports revealed that in Niger and the interior communities BH is already taking advantage of the persistent food shortage as a tool to entice and recruit fighters, and providing food for sustenance for IDPs escaping from BH is a pressing priority and the community expects the government to address this critical needs of its citizens."
"If the Ministry for Local Government and Emirates Affairs is able to facilitate free access to farm machinery by 3500 farmers in liberated communities in this current farming season, then agricultural activities will increase in the focal region and the IDPs will be able to grow their own food, because lack of machinery support to till the shrub infested farmlands of the returning IDPs is a primary hurdle to taking advantage of the current rain season, and most IDPs are peasant farmers and such support is currently a pressing community priority and the community expects the government to address this critical needs of its citizens. We assume that the current enthusiasm and commitment of the BOSG to support this scheme with politicalwill and needed farm machinery hardware donations will be sustained, and also the current security gains that made the area accessible will hold, continue to improve and not deteriorate."
"If we provide STTA assistance based in Maidugury to the USAID Mission, then the USAID Mission will be better informed and more able to allocate scarce resources and respond to emerging issues because USAID is currently operating without full information due to the lack of a direct report in Maidugury. "
"If the Centre for Creative Teaching Abuja organizes the exhibitions and is able to reach enthusiasts from various organizations and government agencies in three major cities of Nigeria and raised awareness about the positive human interest realities of people in Maiduguri, then people will begin to catch up with prevailing realities in the NE, recognizing potentials, opportunities and challenges. This will facilitate changes in perceptions among people about the region and draw up support for actions to assist its needs. Because long term neglect of the region by the center and the frustration by successive governments had continually bred feelings of despair and marginalization in communities."
"If the Maiduguri Metropolitan Council is able to respond to priority needs of Ajaganaram community by engaging 50 community youths to work for cash to clear 3 blocked drainage systems, and equally reaching 250 community members with flood awareness messages, then we would have strengthened community mitigation actions against flood disaster and ultimately contributed to improving the perception that the BOSG care about its citizens and is responsive to issues that affects them. Because, such feelings of neglect and perceived inactions on the part of the government in the past have immensely contributed to lack of cooperation and fueled appeals to VE ideas by the citizens."
"If MMC is able to respond to priority needs of Bolori community by engaging 50 community youths to work for cash to clear 3 blocked drainage systems, and equally reaching 250 community members with flood awareness messages, then we would have strengthened community mitigation actions against flood disaster and ultimately contributed to improving the perception that the BOSG care about its citizens and is responsive to issues that affects them.

Because, such feelings of neglect and perceived inactions on the part of the government in the past have immensely contributed to lack of cooperation and fueled appeals to VE ideas by the citizens."
"If the burnt down and vandalized Nganzai LGA secretariat office complex is rehabilitated and put in habitable condition, then work will likely resume in the rehabilitated complex and the people will see and recognize the commitment of the government to return civil authority to the liberated LGA. This will improve the perception that peace is quickly returning to communities and that the BOSG care about its citizens.  This will occur because it improves upon  the past,when such feelings of fear, neglect and perceived inactions on the part of the government have immensely contributed to lack of cooperation and resistance by citizens to return to liberated areas."
"If the burnt down and vandalized Nganzai LGA secretariat office complex is furnished with office equipment and appliances, then work will resume in the functional and rehabilitated complex and the people will see and recognize the commitment of the government to return civil authority to the liberated LGA. This will improve the perception that peace is quickly returning to communities and that the BOSG care about its citizens.  This will occur because it improves upon the past, when such feelings of fear, neglect and perceived inactions on the part of the government had immensely contributed to lack of cooperation and resistance by citizensto return liberated areas."
"If Nganzai LGA is seen to celebrate the popular Sada'a event, then a strong signal is sent across the state that peace had returned and the people will see and recognize the commitment of the government to return civil authority to the liberated LGA. This will improve the perception that peace is quickly returning to communities and that the BOSG care about its citizens.  This will occur because it improves upon  the past, when  feelings of fear, neglect and perceived inactions on the part of the government have immensely contributed to lack of cooperation and resistance by citizens to return to liberated areas."
"If the burnt down and vandalized Mafa Government lodge is rehabilitated and put in habitable condition, then work will likely resume in the facility and the people will see and recognize the commitment of the government to return civil authority to the liberated LGA.

This will occur because it improves upon the past, when feelings of fear, neglect and perceived inactions on the part of the government have immensely contributed to lack of cooperation and resistance by citizens to return to liberated areas."
"If the burnt down and vandalized Palace of the District Head of Mafa is rehabilitated and furnished, then the traditional ruler will return and resume traditional administration in the facility and the people will see and recognize the commitment of the government to return all forms of civil authority to the liberated LGA. This will improve the perception that peace is quickly returning to communities and that the BOSG care about its citizens.  This will occur because it improves upon the past, when such feelings of fear, neglect and perceived inactions on the part of the government have immensely contributed to lack of cooperation and resistance by citizens to return to liberated areas."
" If the burnt down and vandalized Divisional Police Station in Nganzai LGA is rehabilitated and furnished with office equipment and appliances, then the over sixty personnel currently deployed to the area will find conducive workspace to resume in the rehabilitated and functional offices, coupled with that the people will see and recognize the commitment of the government to return civil authority to the liberated LGA. This will improve the perception that peace is quickly returning to communities and that the Government care about its citizens.  This will occur because it improves upon the past, when such feelings of fear, neglect and perceived inactions on the part of the government had immensely contributed to lack of cooperation and resistance by citizens to return liberated areas."
" If the burnt down police living quarters in Nganzai LGA is rehabilitated and furnished with basic furniture and appliances, then the over sixty personnel currently deployed to the area will find conducive accommodation spaces to resume and settle in dignity, coupled with this the people will see and recognize the commitment of the government to return civil authority to the liberated LGA. This will improve the perception that peace is quickly returning to communities and that the Government care about its citizens.  This will occur because it improves upon the past, when such feelings of fear, neglect and perceived inactions on the part of the government had immensely contributed to lack of cooperation and resistance by citizens to return liberated areas."
"If we support the Rehabilitation Centre with recreational facilities, clothing, covering, personal sanitary items and formula feed, then we would have helped to demonstrate the capacity and efforts of the BSMWA&SW to meet the physical and psychological needs of the over 400 camp residents who are children. This will show that BOSG is serious about leading a credible process of Reintegration and Rehabilitation of the survivors of BH insurgency, absence of which had in the past led to criticism and serious faulting plus undermining of any effort by the government by critics. This will ultimately create the basis for increased defection and thus weaken the ability of BH to regroup and continue any terror acts in the NE. This will happen because people currently want to defect from Boko Haram, but are not leaving because they are fearful of being killed or, at best, stigmatized within their communities, also any successful reintegration efforts will also help to repair social fabric in communities hitherto impacted by the insurgency in the NE of Nigeria.."
"If we assist the BOSG to rehabilitate and reconstruct the youth recreation and sports center in Chibok Community, then there will be a safe and reliable space for youth engagement that will enhance trust and cooperation among them which will improve the decimated social fabric in the community and reduce the ability of Boko Haram and other violent extremist groups to manipulate them with divisive and extremists ideas. this is becasue the Boko Haram terrorists group has used community divisions and mistrust to offer power and revenge as benefits to marginalized segments of society specially the youths, and violent extremist groups threaten to do this again in the future. also the actions of Boko Haram have exacerbated already existing tensions in the North East, and a divided and fearful community is more hospitable to extremist infiltration than one with strong social bonds. "
"If BOSG through the efforts of Nganzai LGA is seen to provide safe water for domestic and other uses to the three communities in the LGA, then the citizens will feel cared for and supported by government at these critical times of need, this will make them recognize and support the efforts of BOSG to ensure safe returns of IDPs to communities of origin. Because lack of safe and usable water by communities had been a huge hindrance factor in the return of IDPs to liberated communities. This effort assumes that the current political will and thrust of the BOSG will be sustained and also the gains by security agencies will be sustained and not deteriorate."
"If we support Peace FM radio station with worktools, office appliances and equipment, then the station will improve its production of content, broadcast capabilities and signal. The station will then be able to produce and air the interactive lifeline communication program which will reach IDPs across borders and unsafe terrains with factual and real time information. This will serve as direct motivation for citizens to reachout for linkage. Because lack of such dedicated program in the past has continued to make the citizens afraid of returning to liberated communities and limited the efforts of the BOSG to facilitate and return of IDPs to areas reclaimed from the insurgents. This activity will ultimately facilitate the repair of the destroyed social fabric in the NE by fostering cross border learning and information sharing about the BH insurgency. This effort assumes that the current goodwill enjoyed with the awardee, current political will and thrust of the BOSG will be sustained, and also the gains by security agencies will hold and not deteriorate."
"If the destroyed and vandalized facilities in the court are rehabilitated and furnished, then the judges will return and resume judicial administration in the facility and the people will see and recognize the commitment of the government to return all forms of civil authority to the liberated LGA. This is because the lack of habitable court facilities is a primary hurdle to the return of judicial administration in Nganzai LGA. This will improve the perception that peace is quickly returning to communities and that the BOSG care about its citizens.  This will occur because it improves upon the past, when such feelings of fear, neglect and perceived inactions on the part of the government have immensely contributed to lack of cooperation and resistance by citizens to return to liberated areas."
"If the BOSG through the State Emergency Management Agency is seen to address safety needs by providing small tools/safety materials to BOYES at selected IDP camps in Maiduguri, this will improve their work in effectively managing their duty posts and will also demonstrate governments commitment to supporting BOYES. This activity will boost the feeling of confidence, care and protection among the camp residents because failure to put in place safety and effective screening methods in the past caused innocent people to lose their lives. While this is a critical activity that is addressing an emerging issue, this activity will help to improve perception of government responsiveness among citizens in Borno State."
"If we support Borno State Ministry of RRR to set up HF communication gadgets at the secretariat in the three LGAs, then we would have assisted the BOSG to enhance timely access to and exchange of information with these previously “information dark spots”. This will improve understanding of these regions, increase prospects for return of civil authority in the LGAs, and ultimately serve as a strong motivation for improved service delivery at the grassroots.

"Problema:La falta de conocimiento de los diferentes mecanismos y estrategias utilizados por entidades de cooperación internacional, multilateral, y actores en los territorios en la ejecución de recursos para proyectos comunitarios con organizaciones de base, puede perderse un aporte muy catalítico para mejorar la ejecución de actividades y proyectos de respuesta rápida y preparación para el postconflicto. Si:Transforma brinda la oportunidad para la Agencia Presidencial de Cooperación (APC) y otras entidades identificar las entidades del orden nacional, de la cooperación internacional y al nivel territorial que han ejecutado proyectos y actividades manejados por comunidades y organizaciones de base,Entonces: A través del los eventos de intercambios de experiencias al nivel territorial, el APC y las entidades clave para la respuesta rápida y preparaciones para el postconflicto puedan tener mayor acceso a información y experiencias que les facilitan ser mas eficaces con su inversión;Porque: Existe una necesidad crítica por parte de las entidades de gobierno claves para la implementación de los acuerdos de paz para vincular a las comunidades donde se focalizaran las acciones del Estado, como actores activos en el proceso de ejecución de los recursos. Existen riesgos por parte de los implementadores de los acuerdos de paz, de que la inversión sin buena coordinación puede generar conflictos e impactos negativos en los territorios y perder oportunidades de catalizar aportes efectivos para la respuesta rápida y la implementacion de los acuerdos de paz.  La experiencia de las entidades de cooperación internacional, y por ejemplo, los Proyectos de Desarrollo y Paz (PDP) en procesos regionales de construcción de paz puede ser canalizada a las entidades del gobierno como un ejemplo y mecanismo de gestión y ejecución."
"Si: La REDPRODEPAZ realiza mesas de intercambio de experiencias y coordinación sobre los Programas de Desarrollo y Paz con entidades de gobierno clave (OACP, MPC) para la implementacion efectivo de los acuerdos.

Porque:El MPC no cuenta con esta información y es clave tenerla en forma rápida para facilitar su planeacion y ejecución de proyectos ERR en preparación para la implementacion de el acuerdo al nivel municipal sobre temas de participación;Se ha identificado que la débil participación en los PDM al nivel municipal es una amenaza a la implementacion del acuerdo al nivel municipal dado que causa inconformidades, falta de apropiación de los acuerdos en los PDM por los autoridades y los ciudadanos creando una falta de legitimidad del gobierno al nivel local. "
"Problema: Los municipios que hacen parte de la ERR (Estrategia de Respuesta Rápida) del MPC se caracterizan por la falta de un sistema de justicia mejor capacitado para atender las demandas locales relacionadas con faltas sociales debido a la baja presencia institucional o porque los sistemas de justicia se concentran en las cabeceras municipales, pero se diluyen en las zonas más apartadas y rurales.Objetivos del Programa: 2. Ejecución de actividades de respuesta rápida desarrolladas dentro de la Estrategia de Respuesta Rápida del Ministerio de PosConflicto que estén focalizadas en el territorio.TOC:2. Support the Ministry of PostConflict and its Rapid Response Strategy to strengthen local justice committees, citizen access to justice and their trust in government institutions such as Ministry of PostConflict. Si:Apoyamos la MPC para la creación y realización de un diplomado sobre mecanismos de justicia comunitaria con 60 inspectores de policía en municipios necesitados en los tres departamentos de Transforma; Entonces:El MPC podrá avanzar con el mejoramiento del acceso de los ciudadanos en comunidades rurales necesitadas a los diversos mecanismos de justicia formal y alternativa como parte de la Estrategia de Respuesta Rápida, tanto construir su confianza en instituciones del gobierno. Porque: Construcción de capacidades de inspectores de policía en municipios remotos puede servir como ""punto de la lanza"" para acceso a la justicia y construcción de confianza entre ciudadanos y gobierno; Inspectores de policía tienen el tiempo e interés en participar en un programa de diplomado de mecanismos de justicia y después aplicar sus nuevos conocimientos y capacidades en sus comunidades; Hay una gran brecha entre las necesidades de acceso a la justicia en comunidades rurales remotas y la oferta institucional del gobierno como respuesta rápida para la transición del conflicto, lo cual es una amenaza a la implementacion del acuerdo de la Habana y la paz al nivel local.

"If We support the OHCP with production and logistics for a traveling art and video ""Peace is with Me"" exhibition in strategic cities for Havana peace agreement implementation; ThenWe will help inform, promote dialogue and mobilize citizens about the Havana agreement and peacebuilding in Villavicencio, Arauca and Cucuta;BecauseThe ""Peace is with Me"" exhibition has already proven to be a successful model for informing, promoting dialogue and mobilizing citizens about the Havana peace agreement and peacebuilding reaching over 6,500 citizens in Bogota; The OHCP does not have the resources or the logistical capacity to reach the territorial level with this kind of strategic activity; Other cities and populations outside of Bogota will be receptive to the exhibition model.

"Problema: Como parte de su proceso de fortalecimiento organizativo, ANUC vuelve a promover su XVI Congreso Nacional, espacio de encuentro de sus dirigentes de todo Colombia que había sido suspendido desde hace varios años como consecuencia del conflicto armado. Para este caso, la idea es congregar en Bogotá a cerca de 600 de sus principales líderes provenientes todo el país. Recientemente, la ANUC ha pedido apoyo a la OACP para la realización de este espacio, el cual resulta fundamental de cara al cumplimiento de los propósitos anteriormente descritos.SI: Transforma apoya a la ANUC y la OACP con apoyo logístico rápido (hotel y alimentación) a hasta 600 de sus miembros, permitirá su participación en el XVI Congreso Nacional de ANUC en Bogota, enfocado en su reparación colectiva y su role en la implementacion del acuerdo de la Habana; Entonces:El ANUC, con el apoyo y coordinacion de la OACP podrá congregar en Bogotá a los líderes de la ANUC de todas las regiones de Colombia para 1) aumentar la visibilidad y legitimidad de la OACP con el ANUC y sus miembros, 2) ratificar sus compromisos para facilitar la reparacion colectiva de ANUC como acordado en la Habana, y 3) fortalecer el papel de ANUC para la implementacion del acuerdo de la Habana. Porque: La OACP podrá comunicar de manera efectiva con los lideres de ANUC temas del proceso de negociación en la Habana, con énfasis en el punto de reparación a victimas colectivas / el ANUC. La OACP no tiene actualmente con agentes territoriales que puedan estar en permanente contacto con las comunidades rurales información y contestando dudas acerca del Acuerdo de la Habana y la reparación colectiva de victimas.  Brindar apoyo logístico rápido es una forma efectiva para lograr el acercamiento de la OACP y los miembros de ANUC, tanto ayudar a llevar acabo el evento que tiene mucho poder simbólico para el país, los territorios tanto la reparación colectiva de ANUC y su empoderamiento y preparación para tener un papel clave en la implementacion del acuerdo de la Habana.

If The Office of the High Commissioner for Peace (OHCP) has resources to hire consultants to provide rapid response technical capacity ); Then The Office of the High Commissioner for Peace will be better positioned to fulfill its mandate regarding readiness and implementation of central components of the Havana peace agreement during the critical pre / post signature period: Because Providing targeted rapid response consultant support is a costeffective and strategic means for Transforma to support the OHCP facilitate Havana peace agreement readiness and implementation; The OHCP has critical unmet rapid response technical and financial needs that must be quickly addressed with human resources / technical support in order to proceed with readiness and eventual Peace agreement implementation at the national and territorial levels; The OHCP does not have other sources of support to fulfill this immediate need because Colombia's FY16 budget did not include new resources required to implement the accords and there is a critical gap in resources that Colombia Transforma (OTI) can fill.

"If We provide timely rapid response logistical support (travel, lodging, event spaces) for consultants and staff from priority national government institutions involved in the peace process (Office of the High Commissioner for PeaceOACP, High Council for PostConflict, Ministry of Justice, among others). Then Enable priority national government institutions fulfill their mandates for peace preparations and initial implementation in Bogota and the territories during critical months pre and postsignature of the Havana peace agreement.Because Providing targeted rapid response consultant support is a costeffective and strategic means for Transforma to support the OHCP facilitate Havana peace agreement readiness and implementation  which is critical now that the final Havana agreement is complete and implementation is close; The OHCP, High Council for PostConflict, Ministry of Justice, others, have critical unmet rapid response needs that must be quickly addressed with human resources / technical support in order to proceed with readiness and Peace agreement implementation at the national and territorial levels; The OHCP and the High Council for PostConflict, Ministry of Justice, others, do not have other sources of support to fulfill this immediate need because Colombia's FY16 budget did not include new resources required to implement the accords and there is a critical gap in resources that Colombia Transforma (OTI) can fill.

"If,VISTAS/USAID provides inkind support (transport, meals, camping gear, chairs and tables, and sound system) for Lekuangole youth conference.Then,Murle youth and traditional authorities will have an opportunity to address the current causes of age set feuds, cattle raiding, and child abduction and reach resolutions to decrease the conflict between the youth.

One of the greatest weaknesses of GIRoA is founded in its inability to bring together representative groups of citizens in order to demonstrate that GIRoA wants and is able to respond to their needs. This in turn generates growing opposition from among the GIRoA's political adversaries whose modus operandi is to disqualify the government by increasing instability in southern Afghanistan. The initiative launched by local subdistrict managers to have more visible shura processes in Kandahar City follows and supports larger scale efforts by the Provincial Governor as a starting point to change this negative trend.
"It has been repeatedly pointed out during shura meetings in the subdistricts in Kandahar City (KC) that communities are highly concerned with the current standard of education and the number of schools available in the city.

Although the situation in the city is far better compared to rural areas, only a couple of districts, mostly in the center of KC (subdistricts 1/2/10), have a sufficient number of schools per the Ministry of Education.

ASISouth assumes that by supporting educational activities, the program will support a government presence that provides basic public services that are visible and responsive to local needs while further bolstering positive governmentcitizen engagement and enhancing the legitimacy of GIRoA."
One of the greatest weaknesses of GIRoA is founded in its inability to bring together groups with different viewpoints about the future of the country and to demonstrate that GIRoA wants and is able to provide a response to their needs. This in turn generates growing opposition from among the GIRoA's political adversaries whose modus operandi is to disqualify the government by increasing instability in southern Afghanistan. The initiative launched by the Provincial Governor is a starting point to change this negative trend.

This activity assumes that providing additional support for shortterm technical assistance to the municipallevel government during a key period of the COIN strategy will promote a properly functioning and responsive local government which is an essential element for stability.
"This activity will serve as a realtime gauge of community satisfaction with ongoing grant activities and facilitate community identification of future interventions and areas of need, expanding the reach of the SD8M's service delivery. Events that are called by the SD8M will involve members from the community where ongoing grants are progressing, presenting opportunities to draw focus to the responsiveness of the SD8M and allowing him to be receptive to input from adjacent communities. By enabling the SD8M to solicit input and feedback from his communities prior to eventual service delivery, he will be highlighted as a receptive, responsive, transparent, and legitimate representative of GIRoA."
"One of the GIRoA greatest weaknesses is transparency and accountability, however, budgetary constraints of the provincial government and line ministries prevent them from supporting ad hoc initiatives that pave the way to a greater government to community interaction.  This activity directly addresses the main strategic priority of the Kandahar Stabilization Plan, and thus ASISouth, to enhance GIRoA presence and responsiveness through outreach events."
"ASI/OTI assumes that in assisting the Afghan Government to respond to the needs of its citizens, by improving school facilities for the city's children, it will improve community perceptions of accountability and responsiveness of GIRoA. This in turn will encourage more active community engagement in and support of the Afghan government's other stabilization activities."
"The key assumptions underlying this  activity supported by USAID/OTI are: (a) that a properly functioning and responsive government is an essential element for stability; (b) that the interactive processes whereby GIRoA is responsive for service delivery, security and governance need to be understood and engaged in by the public; and (c) that public advertisement of the fact that new projects are part of the Hamkari process will cause the local population to identify improved service and infrastructure delivery with the new GIRoA approach."
"ASISouth engagement with communities, as well as Kandahar City executive and line ministry representatives, led to the identification of small grants for the education sector as one facet among a complementary set of projects designed to improve local stability. ASISouth assumes that by supporting educational activities, the program will support a government presence that provides basic public services that are visible and responsive to local needs while further bolstering positive governmentcitizen engagement and enhancing the legitimacy of GIRoA."
"Most Afghans acknowledge the importance of education as a Critical Success Factor to stabilize and develop Afghanistan. In spite of the continuous conflict, there is a persistent resilience amongst the Afghan youth and young adults to educate and improve themselves. All the schools in Kandahar City are neglected. Structurally they are not in a good condition and there is a shortage of basic equipment, school supplies and teaching materials. By renovating the schools, GIRoA's will demonstrate its capability as an effective government to providing education to its citizens. The continuous reinforcement of GIRoA's success as a quality education provider will eventually change the Afghan community's negative perception about GIRoA's effectiveness."
"ASI/OTI assumes that by implementing infrastructure projects effectively and efficiently, confidence in the ability of Kandahar Municipality to deliver essential services will be established within the local community. In turn, it is assumed that this will increase the local community's perception that Kandahar Municipality is capable of effectively governing Kandahar City."
Afghanistan Stabilization Initiative - South (ASIS) in conjunction with the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) assumes that improving the work environment of the provinciallevel government during a key period of the COIN strategy will promote a properly functioning and responsive government - an essential element for stability. It is critical that the Governor's staff have suitable work space to enable them to work at full capacity and deliver muchneeded services to the community.

ASISouth assumes that by sponsoring educational activities, it will support a government presence in Kandahar City: it will enable basic public services to be responsive to local needs, foster positive governmentjcitizen engagement and enhance the legitimacy of GIRoA. Moreover, schools provide a visible representation of a functional government, take children off the street, provide a sense of normality, transcend competing identities and affiliations, and help diversify the prospects for livelihoods through increasing literacy. All of these components are considered to be positive contributors to engendering stability within societies, and make them less susceptible to the influence of insurgent propaganda."
"Engagement with the Kandahar City residents and the SD2 village elders and the SDM has led to the identification of areas needing installation of roadside drainage. Therefore, ASI plans to support this activity because USAID/OTI believes infrastructure development projects are a useful vehicle to strengthen linkages between GIRoA and local communities; these linkages are best demonstrated through tangible activities that they are responsive to community needs. The expected result is enhanced confidence in GIRoA's legitimacy by the community through the government's demonstration of tangible benefits, while responding to the community grievances and showing accountability."

"Upon establishment of the new MSO, Residents of D9 will be able to visit the location to voice their legitimate concerns and seek well coordinated responses from government officials. If concerns are not addressed residents will be able to come to the MSO to meet with municipal officials and hold them accountable according to the rule of law."
"The residents of Kandahar City's neighborhoods furthest from the city center want a functioning government that listens to their complaints and provides solutions.  Establishing a local municipal office in their community will provide an important link connecting residents of SD5 and SD10 to the Kandahar City Mayor's Office.  Rather than traveling to the Mayor's office, the residents of SD5 and SD10 will be able to utilize a facility that is convenient, accessible, and secure."

By providing tangible benefits to the residents of SD9, the community will feel they have a stake in the success of GIRoA and support its other stabilization efforts."
"The residents of Kandahar City's neighborhoods furthest from the city center require a functioning and responsive government that provides tangible solutions to their problems. Establishing a local municipal office in their community will provide an important link between residents of SD10 and SD5 and the Kandahar City Mayor's Office. Rather than traveling to the Mayor's office, the residents of SD10 and SD5 will have access to convenient and secure facility within their vicinity. This will increase the ability of the local government to provide tangible benefits to the more distant residents of these two strategic subdistricts, thus showing the community that they have a stake in the success of GIRoA and harnessing support for its other stabilization efforts."
"Communitytogovernment engagement with the SD9M and Gozar 7 Wakil led to the identification of a key grievance: the dilapidated state of structures to control the rain water runoff in Gozar 7.  ASIS assumes that by supporting governmentled infrastructure development that is responsive to community needs, linkages and interactions between GIRoA and local communities will grow stronger. It is furthermore anticipated that local confidence in GIRoA's ability to provide basic services will also increase."
"Poor provision of basic government services, especially the dilapidated state of public schools, is a major grievance among the residents of Kandahar City's SubDistrict 10. ASI/OTI assumes that, by renovating and repairing high priority public schools, the residents of SubDistrict 10 will begin to perceive they have a tangible stake in the success of GIRoA and will more actively support its other stabilization efforts."
A key stabilization dynamic is the more politically and economically active women are in a conflict impacted community the more stable it becomes. Empowering women in Kandahar City will allow that segment of the population to have a more visible and active role in the direction of events in this city.
"The residents of Kandahar expect GIRoA to provide basic services such as the education of their children.  It is anticipated that, by providing internet access to the Kandahar DoE office, this office will be better able to provide such essential education services to the community. ASIS/OTI assumes that when GIRoA fulfills the communities expectations, the residents of Kandahar will see a tangible stake for themselves in the success of GIRoA.  As a result, the residents of Kandahar will more actively support GIRoA's stabilization efforts."
"The foundation of any effective civilservice is the ability to recruit from a pool of welleducated citizens who feel they have a stake in the success of the government they aspire to join. Welleducated people will be better able to fill civil service positions and eventually strengthen GIRoA's capacity to meet community needs. USAID/OTI assumes that by rapidly increasing the number of welleducated local Afghans through active support will help boost the number of students studying at Kandahar University and that eventually the number of qualified locals who are available for positions with the local, provincial, and national government offices located in Kandahar City will increase and GIRoA's capacity to provide services to meet community needs will also increase."
"The foundation of any successful, licit economic program that creates a stable environment for longerterm economic development is a sound understanding of economic principles that can best be learned in an academic setting.  Rapidly building the capacity of Kandahar University's Economics Department is a quick and sustainable means of providing citizens with access to the necessary skillsets required ensuring Kandahar's growing prosperity and economic development continues."
"The residents of Kandahar City's neighborhoods furthest from the city center require a functioning andresponsive government that provides tangible solutions to their problems. Establishing a local municipal office in their community will provide an important link between residents of SD9, SD10, and SD5 and the Kandahar City Mayor's Office. Rather than traveling to the Mayor's office, the residents of these three subdistricts will have access to a convenient and secure facility within their vicinity. This will increase the ability of the local government to respond to the more distant residents of these three strategic subdistricts, thus showing the community that they have a stake in the success of GIRoA and harnessing their support for future stabilization efforts."
"Effective community engagement via the traditional Afghan leadership mechanism of wakils representing their local communities is the first step to establish an authentic and credible relationship between the Kandahar Municipality, as represented by the respective SubDistrict managers (SDMs), and its constituents. This process will facilitate the identification of the local communities' grievances. The effective resolving of these grievances will demonstrate GIRoA's commitment to effective governance and will be a significant step to rebuild the bridge of trust between GIRoA, as represented by Kandahar Municipality, and the people of Kandahar City. This may lead to increased cooperation between GIRoA and the community, increased unity of effort amongst the Afghan people to stabilize, reconstruct and develop their communities, and an increased resolve to defeat an indiscriminately violent and brutal insurgency."

"The furnishing of the new MSO will enable residents of SD7/8 to visit the location to voice their legitimate concerns; seek wellcoordinated responses from government officials; and hold district officials accountable according to the current legal and legislative provisions. This visible manifestation of GIRoA in SD7/8 will serve to illustrate to the people of the subdistrict the growing capacity and reach of the government. Providing furniture and equipment to the new MSO will enable its employees to work more effectively and efficiently on addressing citizens' needs in a safe, modern and functional environment. Consequently, the capacity of this GIRoA entity will be significantly increased."
"One of the weaknesses of GIRoA is its limited initiatives to engage with young people beyond the provision of formal education and to demonstrate GIRoA's responsiveness to their needs. This can generate a sense of disappointment with the government amongst the youth population, which in turn may contribute to their support for the GIRoA's political adversaries, whose modus operandi is to delegitimize the government by increasing instability in southern Afghanistan. In order to prevent this vicious cycle, it is important for GIRoA to foster a positive relationship with the youth of Afghanistan."
"Kandahar City Stabilization Plan (KCSP) identifies that strengthening communitygovernment relationships and demonstrating GIRoA's readiness to provide basic services to communities in Kandahar are imperative to bring stability in the area. Supporting the community engagement of SD9M and wakils to identify and survey water point in SD9 will help the local government strengthen its presence, tackle community grievances, and defy the prevailing perception of its inability to deliver public services. The successful implementation of this grant will also serve as an example to the adjacent SD8 and 10 that increased links between communities and the local government will lead to more opportunities for tangible infrastructure developments."
"ASIS, OTI and SD8 TL identified pomegranate horticulture training as a stabilizing activity. OTI assumes that supporting DAIL's capacity to provide training for local farmers will improve these farmers  livelihoods and incomes. This activity is expected to strengthen linkages between GIRoA and historicallymarginalized local communities, while spurring economic activity and improving stability."
"By improving the capacity of local NGOs in finance, procurement and administration, ASIS will ensure that future projects with NGO partners are more likely to succeed in their stabilisation goals. In addition, this project will strengthen the ability of Kandahar civil society organisation to professionally present themselves to work with other donors in future, ensuring that the transition  from stabilisation to development is locallyled."
"By training 50 local businesswomen and finalyear students in marketing, business planning, finance, distribution and administration, this activity aims to both boost privatesector growth in Kandahar city and to empower local women. The activity will also improve relations between DOWA and the local businesscommunity, demonstrating GIRoA outreach to previously marginalised communities, and the ability of GIRoA to coordinate and assist the delivery of services through NGOs. In supporting DOWA to respond to the expressed needs of local women, this activity supports the Kandahar City Stabilization Plan (KCSP) goal of being present and responsive."
"Upon receipt of the equipment, the Ministry of Urban Development will have the tools necessary to perform activities related to the:i) identification of issues to be considered in the development of a data collection action planii) formulation of land and infrastructure planning frameworksiii) drafting of localized master plans and budgets for developmentv) identification of procedures for upgrading communities and integrating them into formal functioning society. These activities will provide a visible manifestation of GIRoA serving its people, and illustrate to the citizens of Kandahar the growing capacity and reach of their government."
"The word ""baheer"" refers to the flow  of words, thoughts, the ink from a pen writing poetry  that is inherent to the creative process. Baheer societies are present throughout Afghanistan, although they currently struggle in the South as a result of the fractured, dangerous, and repressive environment. In implementing this activity, BECRO will act as the primary liaison with the Baheer society, leveraging their important cultural role to galvanize youth from all parts of city. ASIS assumes that this grant will support the galvanization of Kandahar City youth around positive messages of Afghan unity, peace, and love through poetry. In doing so, this grant will expose youth from all subdistricts to a positive, representative, and progressive societal influence thus decreasing their susceptibility to AGE propaganda. Additionally, the provision of modern and functional furniture and equipment will make the Baheer library more popular with the Kandahari community, especially youth, thus increasing the number of library users/visitors."
"By training local businesswomen and finalyear students in business development, this activity will boost privatesector growth in Kandahar city and empower local women. Providing this activity will result in improved relations between DOWA and the local business community and demonstrate GIRoA outreach to previously marginalized groups, and the ability of GIRoA to coordinate and assist capacity building interventions through NGOs. Because DOWA's ability to provide competent training professionals to conduct trainings of similar caliber and visibility is limited or nonexistent, utilizing an NGO for this purpose will benefit both DOWA and the target communities. Even though the modules will be delivered by KHDO, DOWA will be perceived as the initiator and leader of the process, as the DOWA Director and staff will be visibly involved at various stages of the training (welcome and introductory remarks, occasional informal visits to the training site and final certificate award ceremony.) While KHDO will receive valuable training experience and build its technical capacity in the process, DOWA will benefit from the visibility of the training among members of the community, which eliminates the possibility of KHDO being seen as a “competitor” by DOWA. Provision of such trainings to the female population in Kandahar will improve  economic opportunity for themselves and their families in the future, thus improving the prospects of higher income and decreasing the probability of idleness and discontent, which makes communities less resilient and more permissible to negative influencers."
"Exclusion of women in terms of both access to government services and their role in society in general hampers the development of the province by not utilizing this potentially important source of skilled labor thus leading to a lack of incentives, enabling environment or assistance for business, as outlined in the Tactical Stability Matrix (TSM.) Given the prevalence of femaleheaded households, marginalization of women and their lack of access to employment affect the abilities of families to improve their economic and social prospects. This activity aims to address this issue by providing vocational training for a group of 20 women through a local NGO, Human Resources Development Agency (HRDA), and in conjunction with the Department of Women's Affairs (DOWA.) This skills training will lead to improvement of  economic opportunity for the women and their families in the future, thus improving the prospects of higher income and decreasing the probability of idleness and discontent, which makes communities less resilient and more permissible to negative influencers."
"ASI engagement with the Kandahar City Mayor and District 8 village elders led to the identification of roadside drainage rehabilitation with the assumption that this infrastructure development project will strengthen linkages between GIRoA and local communities, and that these linkages are best demonstrated through tangible activities that they are responsive to community needs. The expected result is enhanced confidence between GIRoA and community through the demonstration of tangible benefits, while responding to the community grievances and spurring economic activity."
"ASIS engagement with the Kandahar Department of Education and the community of Mir Bazaar led to the identification of the Mir Bazaar School roof repair project, with the assumption that this infrastructure development project will strengthen linkages between GIRoA and local communities, and that these linkages are best demonstrated through tangible activities that are responsive to community needs. The expected result is enhanced confidence between GIRoA and community through the demonstration of clear benefits in response to community grievances and the spurring of economic activity."

IF we conduct street theatre and film screenings in new areas to explore social issues THEN the people from those areas can participate in discussions and develop a sense of awareness BECAUSE they will have a chance to learn and reflect on issues that are prevalent in their communities. 
"IF we provide opportunities to youth to participate in theater performances THEN they will develop a positive value set of pride, ownership and resilience BECAUSE theater is a mode of self expression that leads to personality development."
IF puppet shows are used as a medium of communication to raise awareness on and discuss social and VE issues across the targeted areas of Karachi THEN the target audience will be more aware of social and VE issues plaguing their communities and be able to think critically on how to resolve them BECAUSE the chosen medium of communication (puppet shows) is effective tool for communicating complex ideas in communities with low literacy levels.
IF youth are provided skills and motivation to solve social issues then they can help to reduce the influence of VE groups and narratives in their communities because they will have the leadership skills and the knowledge to mobilize their communities for positive change.

"IF youth are trained to regularly produce newsletters, photo essays and/or blogs based on positive information THEN community members' perception of Lyari will be more likely to shift in a positive direction BECAUSE awareness of ongoing positive developments will reinforce the narrative of pride, unity and resilience."
IF youth are regularly engaged in theater and performance activities that center on conflict resolution THEN they will be able to evaluate and/or address their communities' social and VE issues with more confidence BECAUSE theater education provides an outlet for selfexpression that leads to increased selfawareness and selfconfidence.
"IF youth from selected neighborhoods in Karachi are provided arts education, THEN they will have improved critical thinking skills BECAUSE arts education helps in developing critical thinking skills such as imagination, and skillfully analyzing and assessing issues as well as creating counter narratives to VE. "
"IF football teams from diverse backgrounds participate in a large scale tournament THEN values of diversity, mutual respect, and team building will be promoted BECAUSE bringing people together in a positive, neutral environment can help reduce misconceptions about and hostility towards one another.

Rehabilitation a road will demonstrate the government's commitment to prioritizing the needs of the repatriated community;3. Demonstrating government responsiveness to community identified needs will strengthen ties between the government and repatriated communities."
"If we train 200 females from Tehsil Bara and distribute poultry packages, then we will increase perceptions that the GoP is supporting TDP returns because they will be seen as providing formerly displaced women with a culturally acceptable means of contributing to household income over the long term.  This assumes that: 1. Female TDPs have limited access and resources to contribute to family income, which has hampered their ability to improve their economic conditions;2. Poultry rearing is a culturally acceptable way for women in Bara to earn income;3. The training and provision of startup materials will enable the women to initiate homebased businesses and contribute to improving the overall quality of life of their families;4. An improved socioeconomic profile of returnee families will contribute to the overall socioeconomic development of Bara."
"If we train 60 women from Tehsil Bara in livestock management and distribute relevant tool kits, then we will help support conditions for longterm economic and social development because the trained women will become more selfsufficient in their livelihood activities and minimize potential losses, thus positively affecting their income.This assumes that: 1. Women in Bara are engaged in livestock management and it is an important and culturally acceptable source of livelihoods;  2. The female returnees lack knowledge in livestock management and have limited access and resources to contribute to family income, which has hampered their ability to improve their economic conditions; 3. The training and provision of startup materials will enable the women to initiate homebased businesses and contribute to improving the overall quality of life of their families;4. An improved socioeconomic profile of returnee families will contribute to the overall socioeconomic development of Bara."
"If we organize a sports gala for students from Bara in Khyber Agency, then we will increase youth participation in healthy recreational activities because they will have an opportunity to compete in an interschool sports gala for the first time in years. This assumes that;1. The students in Bara have had limited opportunities in the past to engage in sociocultural activities; 2. Threat of militancy, prevalence of violence, and limited recreational opportunities caused the region to be restive; 3. Conducting this recreational activity will provide youth with a platform to be engaged in positive social activities and less attracted to militancy."
"If we train 25 farmers and two field assistants on improved orchard management techniques, then orchard management skills and knowledge for returnees to Tehsil Bara will increase, because returned orchard farmers in Tehsil Bara lack knowledge about modern orchard management techniques; farmers will be able to maximize their return on produce and opportunities for better livelihoods with the new knowledge and toolkits."
"If 25 honey beekeepers receive training on improved beekeeping management techniques and enterprise development, then the participants will increase their opportunities for better livelihoods, because repatriated individuals lack livelihood opportunities and beekeeping enterprises are a good source of income in the region."
"If MinorE canal is constructed and rehabilitated, then cultivable land for returnees to Tehsil Bara will increase, because the area lacks a consistent water source for field irrigation and families rely on agriculture to sustain their livelihoods."
"If MinorE canal is constructed and rehabilitated, then cultivable land for returnees to Tehsil Bara will increase, because the area lacks a consistent water source for field irrigation and families rely on agriculture to sustain their livelihoods."
"If MinorE canal is constructed and rehabilitated, then cultivable land for returnees to Tehsil Bara will increase, because the area lacks a consistent water source for field irrigation and families rely on agriculture to sustain their livelihoods."
"If we construct a road from Wali Abad to Derya Khan Kili, then mobility of community members in the Bar Qambar Khel area will increase because the community lacks adequate transportation infrastructure."
"If we blacktop Bara Bypass road, then mobility of community members in Shalobar, Tehsil Bara will increase because the community lacks adequate transportation infrastructure."
"If we construct a road from Frontier road to Miran Talab road, then mobility of community members in the Aka Khel area will increase because the community lacks adequate transportation infrastructure."
"If we construct a road from Frontier road to Miran Talab road, then mobility of community members in the Aka Khel area will increase because the community lacks adequate transportation infrastructure."
"If MinorG canal is constructed and rehabilitated, then cultivable land for returnees to Tehsil Bara will increase, because the area lacks a consistent water source for field irrigation and families rely on agriculture to sustain their livelihoods."
"If MinorG canal is constructed and rehabilitated, then cultivable land for returnees to Tehsil Bara will increase, because the area lacks a consistent water source for field irrigation and families rely on agriculture to sustain their livelihoods."
Activity Justification (Theory of Change):IF small scale community based activities are conducted THEN positive interaction between different stakeholders in district Malir will increase   BECAUSE  Targeted stakeholders lack formal opportunities to come together to discuss and address issues within their community Community activities/gatherings at local level play an important role in bringing various stakeholders together to discuss local issues and suggest a way forward  Locally identified solutions will promote future collaboration and increase community ownership and interest in the activities
"IF conversation clubs for youth are developed in public libraries THEN positive interaction between different stakeholders in district Central will increase BECAUSE  Conversation clubs that offer free, positive social engagement will attract more youth to start using libraries Libraries will start generating activity and become functional community spaces for longer term use There is interest among the targeted area in improving English language skills but few opportunities to do so "
"IF a cleanliness campaign is initiated in collaboration with government representatives THEN positive interaction between different stakeholders in Korangi will increase BECAUSE  Cleanliness campaign is an effective way to bring different stakeholders on board to discuss local issues and share ideas for the betterment of the community  The high demand of cleanliness in the area make them an ideal, highlyvisible means by which to bring together diverse groups of stakeholders so that they can interact"
"If target youth are engaged in sports activities, THEN positive interaction between different stakeholders in Korangi will increase BECAUSE  Sports activities are popular and readily accepted within the targeted areas, making them an effective entry point to discuss more sensitive topics  The popularity of sports activities makes them an ideal, highlyvisible means by which to bring together diverse groups of stakeholders so that they can interact These positive interactions provide a starting point for future interaction and collaboration between community members"
"IF technical skills trainings are provided to youth THEN positive interaction between different stakeholders in District West will increase, BECAUSE  Improved skills can generate the opportunities to engage in social or economic activities together  There is a lack of employment opportunities and technical skills trainings for youth that can be a medium for improved interaction"
"IF sociocultural activities are organized in Malir THEN there will be increased positive interaction between different stakeholders in District Malir, BECAUSE Sociocultural activities play an important role in bringing various stakeholders together to discuss local issues Sociocultural activities are popular and readily accepted within the targeted areas, making them an effective entry point to discuss more sensitive topics  The popularity of sports and sociocultural activities makes them an ideal, highlyvisible means by which to bring together diverse groups of stakeholders so that they can interact These positive interactions provide a starting point for future interaction and collaboration between community members"

If the Mohalla Committees are established in UC Sakhi Hassan]” - “then [there will be an increase in positive interaction between different stakeholders in UC Sakhi Hassan - because Community level platforms are key to bringing various stakeholders together along common issues Such platforms have greater ownership of the community and are accepted and trusted well in the target areas and a great entry point for discussing sensitive issues 
"Enabling the District Governor to provide the hospitality of a meal while hosting shuras with the tribal elders and community members of Khakrez will bolster his position, promote regular and increased attendance at future shuras, and improve the perception of GIRoA's willingness to engage in participatory governance."
"If UCBI provides targeted support to local partners that are assisting arriving IDPs, it will reinforce and help sustain volunteer efforts, build confidence in local (both government and nongovernmental) efforts to support IDPs and enable communities to mitigate the impact of the crisis.  "
"If UCBI provides targeted support to active youth committed to contributing to the development of Slovyansk through training on community development and project management, youth will be empowered and encouraged to articulate and realize their vision for the development of Slovyansk; in addition, the youth will be equipped with the tools and knowledge they need to engage and negotiate with the local administration to  achieve their goals, thus increasing interaction between citizens and government and increasing confidence of citizens that government can be responsive to their needs in the wake of the conflict."
"The city administration of Slovyansk faces an administrative and resource gap that hinders its ability to respond to the spectrum of urgent community priorities in the wake of the conflict, including the repair of Kindergarten No. 6.  If UCBI provides the equipment needed to repair this specialized kindergarten, a source of local tension directly attributable to the conflict will be alleviated, enabling parents to focus efforts on normalizing other aspects of their daily lives, and the local government to focus resources on other urgent community priorities."
Assumption 1  Supporting this event will bolster the District Governors legitimacy.Assumption 2  Having members of both governmental entities fellowship over food while celebrating a collaborative job well done will create the space for the dialogue necessary to strengthen these linkages. Assumption 3  Supporting GIRoA institutions will assist with stability in the region.
"If proposed activities involving the repair and rehabilitation of IDP housing and infrastructure damaged as a result of the conflict are better assessed and articulated, UCBI will be able to respond more efficiently and effectively to proposals by accelerating activity development and implementation while reducing risk, thereby improving perceptions of UCBI as a responsive grants program, and increasing the governmental and nongovernmental response to the needs of those affected by the IDP crisis and conflict."
"While host communities throughout the country have done well to manage the IDP crisis to date, the lack of legislation addressing the IDP crisis, diminishing housing capacity, strained public services, the length of the crisis, and unease about the coming winter are beginning to result in social and political tensions.  If UCBI provides targeted support to local partners that are assisting vulnerable IDPs, it will reinforce and help sustain volunteer efforts, build confidence in local (both government and nongovernmental) efforts to support IDPs and enable communities to mitigate the impact of the crisis.  Further, this grant is an entry point activity that will, initially, help UCBI establish relationships with local stakeholders and demonstrate the programs intention to work impartially across the government/civil society divide. Ultimately, the activity will enable UCBI, in the short to medium term, to identify opportunities to bring together civil society and government stakeholders to collaborate on parallel efforts and, in the long term, build trust and bridge the divide between the two sides."
"If UCBI provides support to increase the level of computer literacy among IDPs in Kharkiv, then they will strengthen their ability to search for and apply for jobs, and learn about and apply for state and nonstate assistance. Increased selfsufficiency will reduce divisions or tensions between IDPs and the host community, and there will be will be more constructive collaboration among different stakeholders."
"The city administration of Slovyansk faces an administrative and resource gap that hinders its ability to respond to the spectrum of urgent community priorities in the wake of the conflict, leaving it almost wholly unable to respond to community development initiatives that are not, at first glance, directly attributable to the conflict. If UCBI provides the items and materials needed to help the Slovyansk City Park and its NGO partner Gurtom rehabilitate a section of the park, not only will the park improve its ability to attract local residents, but the local administration will be able to demonstrate its capacity to respond to and cooperate with its citizens. Additionally, through the provision of items and materials to help rehabilitate a section of Slovyansk City Park, UCBI will gain credibility among active civil society in pursuing community development projects, as well as gain the trust of the local administration that UCBI is committed to helping improve their engagement with citizens."
"If UCBI supports facilitated group dialogue between local authorities and civic actors in Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, then they will work together to identify and address issues of mutual concern for their communities.  Communities in liberated areas of northern Donetsk, including Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, have not only been damaged and splintered by the conflict, but also suffer from longstanding mistrust between local government and their constituents. These cleavages discourage constructive engagement among civic actors and with government counterparts.  Building a common vision for community improvement will enhance community resilience."
"If UCBI provides support in organizing meetings to establish a community of IDPs in Kharkiv city and enable them to help each other, then they will have more support to overcome difficulties related to their status as IDPs. Increased selfsufficiency will decrease resistance in the local community towards IDPs, and there will be will be more constructive collaboration among different stakeholders. In addition there will be increased interaction between IDPs and strengthened confidence among IDPs."
"If a key youth demographic is exposed to the value and benefits of civic engagement and supported in undertaking small civic initiatives then development of civil society, empowered to better identify and mitigate tensions and demonstrate positive change in fragile communities, will be cultivated. Youth represent a potential avenue to champion the type of active engagement, which is resilient to external influences and can mitigate destabilizing factors in the community. However, since young people are not adequately engaged, nor have opportunities to act on their priorities, this potential is not realized.  Having a better understanding of civic responsibility and being empowered to engage in civic activism will encourage youth to play a more proactive role in producing positive change in their communities."
"If a targeted group of up to 35 active, civicminded youth from Slovyansk and neighboring communities are trained on civic awareness raising and community development, then there will be more constructive engagement between different parts of the community and there will also be a larger and growing group of active youths who are interested in making constructive improvements to their community because the trainees will be better equipped to mobilize the local community and identify common goals."
"If the Luhansk Oblast Department of Social Protection is able to reestablish its core functions and effectively address requests for social assistance from vulnerable and IDP populations, services will be delivered more efficiently, and citizens will be more aware of the services available from the oblast government. "
"If the Luhansk Oblast Department of Economic Development is able to reestablish its core functions, citizens and institutions in need will receive key government services, empowering them to address socioeconomic challenges caused by the conflict, while promoting constructive engagement between government and citizens. "
"If UCBI provides opportunities to local youth to engage in civic life, then they will be better equipped to constructively engage with local government. This is because more informed and experienced youth will more actively pursue opportunities to undertake community improvements.  In the year since Slovyansk was liberated from separatists control, a number of civil society focusing on providing humanitarian support have emerged, as well as a number of adhoc civic initiatives groups, representing potentially divisive political backgrounds. While well meaning, these groups have lacked organization focus and capacity.  This activity will provide a platform for youth to engage in a positive, nonpolitical and organized structure, laying the groundwork for future civic engagement."
"If the AUC convenes a series of fora that bring together key government and civil society stakeholders and IDP representatives, then these stakeholders will be better equipped to utilize their resources to address critical problems in divided communities. This is because a critical platform will be established to identify community challenges and priorities and bring new opportunities for constructive engagement between government and citizens. "
"If UCBI supports the creation of an independent oblastwide independent newspaper in Kharkiv, then citizens living in this area will be less vulnerable to manipulation via political propaganda. This is because residents offered access to alternative resources that provide accurate, unbiased information about the conflict and critical reform issues are more likely to be less susceptible to the manipulative messages presented in traditional media and be aware of the myriad issues fueling dissatisfaction with local authorities and division between groups.   Moreover, if opinion leaders such as government officials and community leaders and equipped with an alternative view and information not available in traditional media, "
"If IDP and host community residents in Rubizhne have access to critical information about the conflict and conflictrelated issues then they will be empowered to effect positive change in their lives and their city. This is because a lack of information or disinformation results in disempowerment, while access to more and better information empowers people to make informed decisions."
"Youth lack access to objective information with which to make decisions to more actively engage in civic life and resist manipulation and external influence. If UCBI can support a targeted group of Kharkiv youth to raise their level of media literacy and journalism skills, they will improve their role as both producers and consumers of information. This is because the more people understand how information is created and disseminated, and see the opportunities for manipulation and exploitation the more they will pursue trustworthy information sources and positively engage in public life."
"If UCBI obtains relevant and timely information to help us identify issues/change makers in targeted rayons (districts) in Kharkiv oblast, then UCBI can better assist these communities and use change makers to address critical conflictrelated issues. This is because UCBI will have addressed a gap in information and use this information to make strategic programming decisions."
"If UCBI increases the capacity of Station Kharkiv to expand assistance and services for IDPs resettled in Kharkiv, it will reduce strain on local resources and promote social cohesion, because IDPs will be better able to integrate and function as independent members of the community. "
"If potentially divided communities in Kharkiv and Donetsk oblasts are provided with opportunities to share their personal experiences in a safe environment, then there will be greater tolerance of other opinions and prospects for collaboration. This is because improved understanding of conflictrelated challenges and dynamics within communities will help people find common areas of interest."
"If UCBI builds the capacity of key providers of assistance to IDPs and other vulnerable groups in Slovyansk, the government will be better equipped (and be perceived to be better equipped) to respond to citizens' needs now and in the event of a new wave of IDPs. This is because city staff who perform their current functions more effectively will be better positioned to absorb increased responsibilities should the situation necessitate."
"If the tireless efforts of volunteers around Kharkiv oblast to help IDPs and others affected by the current conflict are acknowledged and praised by the oblast government, there will be increased understanding of the vital role of volunteerism and civic engagement and decreased tensions between IDP and host communities. This is because personal portrayals, captured in video and photography, of the impact that individuals and organizations can have on people's lives will resonate more strongly than dry pronouncements from government officials."
"If participants in a citywide event are able to send a message of peace and unity for Kharkiv, then more people will be encouraged to stand up for stability and unity in this strategic city, thus creating a stronger voice against attempts to destabilize the city. This is because seeing potentially thousands of people sporting a message of unity and peace will give others the confidence to speak out against violence."
"If UCBI supports the efforts of a local organization to conduct public performances and a festival (including breakdancing, local public information campaigning, arts, etc.) for local citizens and IDPs in Kharkiv, it will boost morale while building confidence and a modern national identity of local citizens and help deepen the integration of IDPs into host communities. Providing targeted support to communities and local partners that are experiencing and addressing the destabilizing effects of the conflict will reinforce and help sustain volunteer efforts, mitigate tensions, and build confidence, ultimately resulting in more resilient communities."
"If IDPs and host community residents are given the space and opportunity to interact in a safe environment, it will increase social cohesion and facilitate the integration of IDPs into their new communities. This is because the root of current tensions in host communities is perceived cultural differences as well as lack of opportunities for positive interaction. "
"If 20 selected youth who have been displaced due to the annexation of Crimea and the open conflict in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts are given the opportunity to share their personal experiences and build understanding with one another through photography and writing in a high profile and public Nat Geo photo camp activity, then their personal stories of the impact of Ukraine's conflict will resonate more broadly among a national and international audience. This is because Nat Geo's experience and reputation will ensure a high level of attention and credibility to a broad local and national audience to the stories told by a small number of youths. "

This is because Nat Geo's experience and reputation will ensure a high level of attention and credibility to a broad local and national audience to the stories told by a small number of youths. "
"If IDP children who have missed out on school and crucial childhood interaction and experiences are given targeted educational help in a supportive and fun summer camp environment, a key resilience factor will be addressed. This is because children who feel safe, secure, and cared for are better able cope with family stress due to the conflict and relocation."
"If UCBI provides opportunities for IDP youth and host community youth to engage in positive interactions, cooperation and civic activism, UCBI will mitigate social tensions and suspicions characterizing host community and IDP youth relations. This is because informed and empowered youth can be key drivers of change in Kharkiv and the rest of the country."
"Providing IDPs with the opportunity to visit parts of central Ukraine that have stated that they can accommodate IDPs will help diminish negative views about the government in Kyiv and/or perceptions of Ukraine's transition, as well as increase access to objective information with which IDPs can make decisions about their future. These visits will also increase social cohesion by proactively promoting the engagement and integration of IDPs into new communities in order to reduce strains on local resources and services in Donetsk and increasing resiliency and public confidence in the government. This is because IDPs who obtain and share firsthand information on conditions in other localities of the country are seen as more “honest brokers” within the IDP communities that are hesitant to relocate outside of Donetsk oblast."
"By providing technical and material assistance to the Kharkiv state emergency services, UCBI will improve public confidence and morale in a key area which is targeted by external influences,  because appropriate authorities will have increased capacity to respond to or mitigate the threat of emergency situations and deliver critical and consistent messages about the crisis and other key issues, including lifesaving and emergency services to the public."
"If UCBI helps to foster discussion and engagement around key issues through an interactive and inclusive forum, such as music, grievances undermining confidence will be addressed. This is because people who may have been manipulated against Ukraine's transition will be engaged in an open and nonthreatening manner that encourages reconsideration of firmly held stereotypes or traditions."
"If UCBI supports the establishment of the Novoye Mesto CoWorking Center in Kharkiv, targeting IDP entrepreneurs, former ATO businesses and activists, then it will strengthen a key resiliency and community cohesion, because competition for jobs, and the inability of IDPs to enter the formal economy are resulting in potentially destabilizing tensions which erode community cohesion in Kharkiv.  "
"If resources are available for timely response to emergencies and displacement flows, these activities can be used to reduce fears, misperceptions and promote relationships and cohesion between IDPs and host communities. "
"If UCBI strengthens the capacity of the primary civil society IDP support organization and provides opportunities for IDPs to engage in public life in a way that encourages membership or selfsufficiency, particularly in cooperation with host community members, IDPs can be empowered as a key resilience, and host community fears will be addressed, strengthening community cohesion.  Because, while the number of IDPs in northern Donetsk is very large and fluid, civil society continues to play the primary role in their support and social integration, and the recipient of this grant, because of its strong ties to local government and the international community, is the only civil society organization in the region with the potential to transition from basic support for IDPs to social integration and cohesion strengthening. "
"If UCBI directs employment efforts at the most in demand jobs ,and provides information aimed at helping job seekers be more mobile, seek opportunities where there is less demand, and promote success stories, perceptions of  competition for jobs, a key point of tension between host community members and IDPs, as well as a driver of misinformation and stereotypes will be mitigated.  "
"If local organizations improve their capacity to identify and mitigate the deep emotional stresses responsible for volunteer burnout, then community level service providers can continue to play a critical role in mitigating the adverse effects of the conflict for hundreds of vulnerable people because these organizations will have a more resilient, mentally healthy, and reliable staff to continue the work. "
"If UCBI provides 90 entrepreneurs in target communities in eastern Ukraine with individual business plans that align with a strategic business sector, it will reduce threats to community cohesion. This is because key entrepreneurs and employers, from influential industries which had traditional markets in Donbas and Russia, will be better equipped and more confident about their economic prospects, and the target communities will be better positioned to regrow their local economies."
"If UCBI provides support to increase the level of computer literacy among IDPs and social opportunities that promote integration between IDPs and host community members in Kharkiv, then a key demographic that is at risk of social and economic exclusion will increase their prospects for selfsufficiency and confidence. The ability to become familiar and more skilled in common technology will make IDPs better able to integrate into economic spheres of life, and the opportunity to participate in cultural and social events with host community members will create relationships and increase confidence. Together, these enhanced skills and new degree of confidence will increase selfsufficiency. Increased selfsufficiency will help reduce divisions or tensions between IDPs and the host community and promote social inclusion of a vulnerable group in a conflictaffected community."
"By enabling constructive dialogue and interaction between citizens and local government, particularly with regards to reforms, UCBI will improve relationships and perceptions between government and citizens, and create a process to addresses key local challenges.  As a result, grievances underlying community cohesion and mistrust in local authorities will be reduced.  This is because, while polling shows that citizens rarely engage with local government, because there are few opportunities and trusted intermediaries to facilitate discussion.  This activity will provide both the opportunity and intermediary to facilitate that discussion. "
"If UCBI helps foster discussion and engagement around key issues, such as reform and security, then grievances undermining confidence to be addressed. This is because greater transparency and engagement improves outlook and vested interest in key issues, specifically treatment of people crossing through Ukrainian checkpoints along the contact line. This issue in particular, corruption and abuse of Ukrainians crossing the ""contact line"" has become a significant issue grievance for Ukrainians both both sides of the line, and evidence that old ways of doing business with government remain. Also, this effort is supported by the Oblast administration, which has requested assistance to document corruption and human rights abuses, and has expressed a willingness to address infractions."
"If youth in vulnerable communities of Kharkiv are educated about recycling and the importance of protecting the environment, then a new constituent group will be created to demand accountability from the local government, not only in this area but in others that will impact Ukraine's transition who will be more vested in the democratic future of Ukraine. This is because a more informed population, particularly in communities that have been political and economically isolated, is more likely to demand improvements to their communities, as well as contribute to these improvements, and recycling and ecology is an priority issue for these communities."
"If UCBI continues support of an independent oblastwide independent newspaper in Kharkiv, then residents will be less vulnerable to manipulation via political propaganda. This is because residents offered access to alternative resources that provide accurate, unbiased information about the conflict and critical reform issues are more likely to be less susceptible to the manipulative messages presented in traditional media and be aware of the myriad issues fueling dissatisfaction with local authorities and division between groups.  Moreover, opinion leaders such as government officials and community leaders will be equipped with an alternative view and information not available in traditional media,"
"Providing these civil servants on the frontline of government provision of services with opportunities to improve their capacity to deliver quality services more efficiently and humanely will help reduce tensions and frustrations around limited resources in a conflict affected community, as improved customer service practices will improve civil servants' outlook on their role, as well as improve the delivery of crucial social services to the city's most vulnerable residents."
"If UCBI supports development of the Slovyansk central library, Slovyansk residents will become more civically engaged. This is because a better equipped library will have greater capacity to host more events, attract more visitors, and assist more citizens."
"Helping reequip a leading university in Luhansk oblast will increase the confidence of displaced students who are currently studying at the university or wish to return to the university and close the gap in education caused by the conflict. In addition, helping this historic institution maintain its position in Luhansk oblast will slow down the brain drain from Luhansk. Without strong educational institutions, there is less motivation for young people to come to or remain in Luhansk oblast.  Since there are few educational opportunities for young people in liberated Luhansk, spaces at universities are limited and displaced students are often forced to take spots from local students or move to other locations. By increased the capacity of displaced universities, students will not compete for resources or leave the region."

Since there are few educational opportunities for young people in liberated Luhansk, spaces at universities are limited and displaced students are often forced to take spots from local students or move to other locations. By increased the capacity of dispalced universities, students will not compete for resources or leave the region."
"If UCBI provides innovative and secure opportunities for ATO veterans and their families to obtain needed psychosocial support, then their psychological health will improve, they will be more open to expressing and listening to their experiences, and they will be better equipped for social reintegration. This is because the continuing stigma attached to or lack of understanding about psychological care constrains many people from getting the help they need and this raises the risk of a key demographic failing to reintegrate into civilian society."
"If UCBI assists in (re)endowing institutions in eastern Ukraine with Ukrainian literature through special cultural events that bring together members of divided communities then there will be greater opportunities to develop understanding of Ukrainian culture, recognition of the unique cultural riches of the country, and establish a platform for communication and understanding. This is because culture is a recognized avenue to bring people from disparate communities together to engage in positive interaction and effect positive changes in attitude."
"If UCBI provides opportunities for local youth to engage in civic life, then they will be better equipped to constructively engage with other citizens. This is because more informed and experienced youth will more actively pursue opportunities to undertake community improvements especially those that attract the wider community.  In the year since Slovyansk was liberated from separatist control, a number of civil society groups focusing on providing humanitarian support have emerged, as well as a number of adhoc civic initiatives groups, representing potentially divisive political backgrounds. While well meaning, these groups have lacked organization focus and capacity. This activity will provide a platform for youth to engage in a positive, nonpolitical, and organized structure, laying the groundwork for future civic engagement."
"If UCBI provides opportunities for local NGO “Moya Edyna” to engage in civic life, then they will be better equipped to initiate civic activism and citizens cooperation for community resilience and strengthening civil society. This is because more informed and experienced community members will more actively pursue positive social changes favorable for better understanding, dialogue between local community and IDPs, their better integration into the local society.  "
"If UCBI supports an indepth civil society mapping exercise in eastern Ukraine, then civil society organizations and activists will obtain a clear understanding of the key challenges that constrain civil society's capacity to effect change in their communities and play a more constructive role in modeling and promotion of national reforms. This is because many CSOs and activists have little experience in constructive networking and collaboration meaning their collective efforts are often wasted."
"If UCBI provides building materials to the Svatove district state administration, then tensions and frustrations around limited resources in conflictaffected communities will be reduced. This is because the district state administration will be able to make essential repairs to 4 educational institutions that lack the financial resources to help themselves."
"If UCBI provides building materials to the Svatove city administration, then tensions and frustrations around limited resources in conflictaffected communities will be reduced. This is because the city administration will be able to make essential repairs to the vulnerable residents and institutions that lack the financial resources to help themselves."
"If the Slovyansk city council introduces an electronic vote tracking system to better manage the results of their deliberations, then decisions will be more accurately documented and resident will be better informed about votes.  As a result, residents will be equipped to make better informed decisions about which local government representatives to support and why. This is because the manner in which voting is conducted currently is nottranparent and well documented and residents, who lack significant trust in government, do not have clear information about how their elected deputies voted on key issues that affect residents' daily lives."
"IF UCBI supports reporting and discussion that increases the amount of accurate information about national reforms in conflict line communities and information about the situation in conflict line communities, among the regional and national stakeholders will be better able to target efforts to include those communities in national and regional social and political life and less feelings of social and political isolation of those communities."
"If UCBI employs a team of public service delivery professionals, then it will both ensure the continued effective functioning of the Odesa ASC while its legal status is determined and ensure the successful establishment of an ASC in Kharkiv.  That is  because there is the political will to use this ""home grown"" expertise and to finalize ASCs in Kharkiv and Odesa, and possibly other locations (e.g, Mariupol)."
"IF UCBI supports an inclusive decision making process that determines a vision and tangible improvements to the central city park which UCBI and other donors will support, THEN citizens in Slovyansk will be more engaged and overall morale will be improved.  BECAUSE, the state of public spaces, and this park in particular, are deemed a significant priority for citizens who have demonstrated a willingness to commit time and effort into the issue.  Also, there have been relatively few cultural or social improvements in this community which is on the front line with current conflict.   "
"If government social services staff gain the techniques and skills to identify symptoms of and overcome stress and burnout, as well as how to respond professionally and sensitively to their most vulnerable customercitizens, then social service delivery will be improved. This is because staff that are better equipped to respond to difficult situations will be able to deflect common triggers to emotional stressors and, therefore, more adeptly address and resolve practical problems."
"If UCBI provides opportunities to local youth and activists to engage in civic life, then they will be better equipped to constructively engage with local government. This is because more informed and experienced youth will more actively pursue opportunities to undertake community improvements. This activity will provide a platform for youth to engage in a positive, nonpolitical and organized structure, laying the groundwork for future civic engagement.  BECAUSE this will be the first youth platform of its kind in the city, and employ a model that has been successful in engaging youth and spurring them to action in similar Donbas communities.  "
"If leading media outlets targeting citizens in the East are both better able to produce TV and Internet friendly content, AND utilize media consumption surveys to better direct that content to their target audience, THEN citizens in the East of Ukraine will be better informed about reform and progress in the country and be less likely to buy into Russian narratives BECAUSE citizens in the East crave accurate and locally sourced information upon which to make decisions. "

"In order to facilitate mitigation/reconciliation efforts at the local level in conflict affected areas in eastern Ukraine, including those that are hosting communities of internally displaced persons (IDPs), UCBI has identified a need for shortterm technical assistance to help UCBI in this crucial initial stage of the project more clearly understand the current political and security environment in eastern Ukraine, identify, build relationships with, and provide advice to prospective grantees and beneficiaries. In the early phase of the period, UCBI does not have plans to establish a permanent office is in eastern Ukraine, however, establishing a presence through the consultant(s) will help UCBI better understand where the greatest needs and opportunities may lie for project activities and will provide stakeholders, grantees, and beneficiaries technical advisory services that would normally come with field presence. The consultant(s) will also serve a vital role in providing continuous updates on the political and security environment in conflict areas, in particular those areas that have been liberated, such as Mariupol, Slovyansk, and Kramatorsk, and other liberated cities as the security situation permits."
"By helping communities in conflict areas to repair critical infrastructure, such as public buildings, the infrastructure require to deliver basic services and in some cases residences, UCBI will help build confidence in the transition and GoU by enabling communities to resume key daily functions soon after the conflict.  Such interventions will be limited in scope, particularly as fighting has not yet come to a close in parts of the east and will not outpace the government of Ukraine's ability to reestablish civilian government in those areas.  UCBI will require a high degree of understanding of the perceptions and dynamics at play in the area, as well as the ability to develop and maintain relationships in this permissive environment."
"The communities in the liberated areas are in a state of sever distress. While the residents of Slovyansk and Kramatork are returning to rebuild the city, deep divisions remain.

Information, in particular about the conflict is often politically manipulated and sensationalized.  Outside expertise will be essential in effectively analyzing these dynamics and providing a fresh perspective on the media environment."
"If UCBI increases the capacity of Dopomoga Dnipra to expand assistance and services for IDPs resettled in Dnipropetrovsk oblast, it will reduce strain on local resources and promote social cohesion, because IDPs will be better able to integrate and function as independent members of the community.  If the organization has an a strategic plan and new skills, it will respond to integration challenges more effectively. If new facilities are built, IDPs and host community members will be given the opportunity to interact and build relationships, and if Dopomoga Dnipra is able to conduct outreach throughout the oblast, it will ensure that potential tensions and problems are not ignored."
"If UCBI obtains relevant and timely information to help us identify issues/change makers in targeted regions (Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, government controlled territories of Donetsk and Luhansk) then UCBI can better assist these communities and use change makers to address critical conflictrelated issues. This is because UCBI will have addressed a gap in information and use this information to make strategic programming decisions."
"If emerging IDP leaders in Zaporizhzhia are given the opportunity to engage with respected community leaders, and are then supported through training and structured capacity building, the IDP community will be empowered to minimize discrimination, host community fears and stereotypes and engage in public life. IDPs in  Zaporizhzhia often shy away from public life, for fear of discrimination and also because they are dispersed in various locations and living arrangements, and also do not have structured ways to organize and advocate for their interests."
"IDPs in Zaporizhzhia are often reclusive and do not interact with their neighbors for a variety of reasons, including fear of discrimination and uncertainty. The end of the school year provides an opportunity to engage IDP and host community children and families in positive social and cultural endeavors. If UCBI supports a series of social, educational and cultural events targeting school aged children in communities or neighborhoods with a high proportion of displaced persons then both children and the adult family members of IDPs and host community members will start building relationships, which will create opportunities for open lines of communication and greater social integration and mitigate tensions and potential conflict."
"If UCBI supports the establishment of a coworking space in Zaporizhzhia targeting youth entrepreneurs, activists and arts, it will strengthen a key resiliency which will be able to improve the morale and economic opportunities for a key group of stakeholders. While directly in the line of the conflict, Zaporizhzhia does not have the same level of pro Ukrainian sentiment or the opportunities for young people in neighboring regions. A coworking center will be unique in Zaporizhzhia  there are currently no coworking centers or similar spaces in which young people can work and collaborate. Zaporizhzhia has a small but proactive group of proUkrainian, reform minded youths. This space will build their credibility and ability to foster a great sense of civic activism and interest in pursuing small business opportunities. "
"If UCBI supports training sessions in creative communications for civic organizations in Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih, and Zaporizhzhia, these groups will be better prepared to create and launch new initiatives that will reinforce community cohesion and decrease the potential for conflict. This is because this activity will promote the development of civil society and equip civicminded community leaders with creative communication tools and skills. "
"If UCBI supports creating an independent oblastwide hybridmedia resource in Kryvyi Rih, then citizens living in this area will become less vulnerable to manipulation via political propaganda. This is because residents offered access to alternative resources that provide accurate, unbiased information about the conflict and critical reform issues are more likely to question the propagandized materials."
"If potentially divided communities in Dnipropetrovsk oblast are provided with opportunities to share their personal experiences, overcome anxiety and uncertainty in a positive and safe environment, then there will be greater tolerance of other opinions and prospects for collaboration. This is because improved understanding of conflictrelated challenges and dynamics within communities will help people find common areas of interest."
"If Ukrainian NGOs and service providers from across Ukraine establish coworking space and strong networks for collaboration, then they will increase their organizational capacity to better serve victims of the conflict because they will be able to efficiently leverage limited resources and better share best practices."
"If UCBI supports this Zaporizhzhia summer camp program then we created opportunities for IDP children to engage in cultural and social activities, positively affecting both their integration perspectives and those of their peers, as well as those of their parents because organized social communication between different groups create mutual trust, friendships, and often lead to possibility of common action."
"If independent media is more efficient, capable, professional and has an expanded reach, it will fill an information void, particularly among key stakeholders who will then be able to make more informed decisions regarding the conflict and transition. "
"If there is a greater investment in building the capacity of Ukrainian journalist to do effective conflict sensitive reporting, then tensions between communities will be reduced because all Ukrainians will have more accurate information about the adverse effects of the crisis and a shared understanding of the facts. Currently, the media often focused on sensational and sometimes biased reporting on the crisis, many times at the expense of fact based, ""news you can use"" information.  By training journalists and providing them the means to conduct less sensational and more useful reporting, two key impediments to integration  lack of information about opportunities and services and widespread stereotypes and misconceptions  will be addressed.  "
"If UCBI supports the development of a series of modules, engagements and interactions between IDP and host community members, there will be greater understanding and improved relationships between the groups, because both IDPs and host community will recognize their shared values and have an opportunity to interact and dispel misperceptions and stereotypes.  "
"If UCBI supports four summer camps  in Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Vinnytsa and Zaporizhzhia it will build the capacity of a key resilience for IDP youth from the Donbas and Crimea to proactively address the challenges resulting from integration which threatens social cohesion in their communities , because during these camp, participants will build relationships, obtain necessary skills and motivation to participate in social activism and youth NGO movement."
"If UCBI supports the establishment of an IDP Business Resource Center in Dnipropetrovsk targeting IDP entrepreneurs, businesses moved from ATO and activists, then it will strengthen a key resiliency and community cohesion. Competition for jobs, and the inability of IDPs to enter the formal economy are resulting in potentially destabilizing tensions which erode community cohesion in Dnipropetrovsk.  Helping IDPs and relocated businesses navigate the local economy will reduce frustrations  and competition for employment  for a key group of stakeholders."
"If UCBI supports the training sessions in creative communications for civic organizations in Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih, and Zaporizhzhia with the experienced local group that can help selecting proper audience and arrange good logistics and services for the activity KYV043, then the quality of trainings will be significantly higher because local knowledge is crucial key to success for initiatives that transfer knowledge and experience."
"If UCBI supports the development of a series of events, engagements and interactions through art and cultural activities that target both IDP and host community members, there will be opportunities to address frustrations, promote unity and self sufficiency creating stronger longterm resilience.  "
"If UCBI has access to local engineering services, then it will be able to include detailed plans to rehabilitate the coworking center as planned under KYV040 in a manner that is most cost effective for UCBI and compliant with US government regulation, because detailed cost estimates and potential environmental impacts are critical to ensure an open, transparent, and efficient tender processes."
"If UCBI helps to foster discussion and engagement around key issues and provide civil society organizations with skills to better address conflict and grievances, it will help local organizations identify ways in which they can improve the impartiality and effectiveness of their service delivery. The grant will not only introduce the concepts of Do No Harm and peace building practices but will also make local organizations and the donor community more aware of potential pitfalls of aid and support in conflict environments.  "
"If independent media is more efficient, capable, professional and has an expanded reach, it will fill an information void, particularly among key stakeholders who will then be able to make more informed decisions regarding the conflict and transition. "
"If UCBI supports IREX to enhance job search capabilities of libraries in the targeted regions which will deliver a suite of informational services to IDPs and host community members, then tensions resulting from competition over employment and economic resources in communities of 5 conflict affected oblasts will be decreased, because cooperation between civil society and government will help address the employment needs of IDPs and long term residents."
"If UCBI conducts an assessment of the practices of local organizations providing humanitarian assistance and community building to conflict affect communities, it will help local organizations identify ways in which they can improve the impartiality and effectiveness of their service delivery. The grant will not only introduce the concepts of do no harm practices but will also make local organizations and the donor community more aware of potential pitfalls.  "
"If UCBI provides opportunities for local community and IDPs in smaller towns and rural areas to participate in civic activism, there will be opportunities to address frustrations, promote unity and selfsufficiency creating stronger long term resilience.  This is because, while civil society is traditionally weak in Zaporizhzhia, it is appreciated and trusted by residents, who also indicate that they are willing to play a greater role in local decision making. Residents are interested in participating in cultural activities and organizations, as seen by both polling recent events implemented by UCBI. Zaporizhzhia has not experienced the same degree of overt Ukrainian Nationalism as in other parts of the country, but its resident's willingness to trust civil society and engage in activism make it a potential model for a unique form of Ukrainian identity if civil society is properly motivated and coordinated."
"If UCBI engages in promoting the provision of support to health services through a coordinated, international donor supported effort, this support will diminish some of the potential sources of tension, marginalization and abandonment of communities located in the ATO in eastern Ukraine.  "
"If UCBI supports an activity that provides a space for free discussion moderated by Ukrainian writers and art activists on modern Ukrainian culture then local western leaning activists will be empowered to lead for inclusive and productive civic engagement around issues of national identity and residents will have a greater vested interest in Ukrainian culture.  Zapporizhzhia does not have a strong civil society, and the community is often characterized as divided between western and eastern mindsets.  This type of engagement, nonpolitical and cultural in nature, will be a unique opportunity to bridge that gap and empower local activists,   "
"By improving participation of citizens in local government elections, UCBI will improve interaction and relationships with constituencies and local government, addressing some of the key grievances underlying community cohesion and reducing mistrust in local authorities through active citizen engagement in democratic processes. "
"If the Course ""Fundamentals of Critical Thinking"" will be adapted according to current informational needs then high school students will be more informed, tolerant and able to resist propaganda because 500 teachers will be trained and ready to incorporate the course into the study curriculum of high schools in Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, government controlled Donetsk and Luhansk regions.  "
"If UCBI and its partners better understand the objectivity, reach, results (outcomes) and perceptions of the activities supported through the program, they will be able to more effectively impact national debate, policy making, and the lives of Ukrainians living in conflict affected areas.   "
"If the Melitopol city administration is able to renovate and open a childcare facility effectively addressing requests for social assistance from vulnerable and IDP populations, it will significantly improve its core functions and provide Melitopol IDPs and host community with better access to strained public childcare services, which would support community cohesion and resilience in the community by reducing competition for limited public resources.. "
"If UCBI utilizes SCORE and has a more nuance understanding of social cohesion and resiliency dynamics in Ukraine, then the program can design more targeted, evidencebased approaches to conflict transformation and social change in its operational areas. "
"By improving the legitimacy of potentially contested elections in key locations with independent data from trained observers and greater information for voters about transparency, citizens' confidence in the election results will be bolstered, because citizens will have the information they need to understand that a fair election process in Ukraine can yield legitimate results. "
"If UCBI bolsters the technical and administrative capacity of civil society organizations in Berdyansk, Melitopol, and Zaporizhzhia City then the community will have more confidence that organizations they trust are working to improve the social, economic, and political environment in the Oblast. This will be because recent polling suggests low levels of trust in all other government and nongovernment sectors on the part of local citizens, but high levels of confidence in local organizations to be change agents. The activity will further empower more people to get involved in organizations they believe in; organizations will be able to do outreach about their activities and impacts; organizations will be able to approach donors and the private sector to promote sustainability; and stronger local networks of NGOs that can leverage and learn from each other will be formed buttressed by greater linkages to local and regional authorities for effective advocacy.  "
"If IDP women are given the opportunity to interact with community peers in a positive learning environment, then they develop improved relationships with host community members and improved understanding of each other. Relationships and perceptions between IDP and host community women are poor because there are few opportunities for interaction and relationships building. Leaders in both groups value topics concerning personal growth and leadership which would serve as a productive medium to bring individuals together and also encouraging leadership and civic engagement. "
"If the Public Chamber of Ukraine conducts 15 youth public discussions, three quests and one brainstorming with university youth in Dnipropetrovsk on the issues of local elections and decentralization, then Dnipropetrovsk University students will be more actively engaged citizens in the runup to the elections.  "
"If the City of Melitopol is able to resource and run 6 after school youth clubs for vulnerable families from the host and IDP communities, then IDPs will have a forum for greater public participation and engagement with their neighbors, because the City provided critical family services in the wake of the ongoing crisis.  "
"If UCBI improves open and transparent citizen and business service delivery on the part of the local government in Odesa, tensions that threaten community cohesion, as well as widely held perceptions of corruption, will be reduced and community resilience will be bolstered. "
"If the getoutthevote campaign targeted at student youth in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia is conducted for and with active participation of university youth in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia, then young adults eligible to vote will be more actively engaged citizens elections because motivational and educational activities are proven methods of youth voter mobilization.  As a result youth will be more vested in the election process and Ukraine's transition and support reformist local government.   "
"If UCBI supports forumtheatre activities in target regions, then local communities and IDPs will have a chance to build dialogue, discuss existing issues related to lives of IDPs and search for solutions together because participatory theater allows everyone to look at the existing community issues in a creative way, to build empathy and search for bottomup solutions."
"If local government is seen to deliver educational services in a more competent, equitable way, then residents will have fewer grievances and increased confidence in the governments ability to provide critical services and implement promised reforms. This is because the State Administration will demonstrate that it understands that the education and educational opportunities for the next generations of Ukrainian youth is a priority for all the citizens of the Oblast  IDP and local. The State Administration will also show it is being responsive to citizens frustration and address a key perceived inequity in access to education. "
"If UCBI provides opportunities for vulnerable communities in the East to discuss decommunization in an  inclusive way, and identify commonly agreed upon alternatives for former Soviet symbols, it will mitigate tensions around a significantly contentious issues, and improve unity.  This is because, in these communities there is not and entirely inclusive process, or the process is not moderated by trusted stakeholders, creating the need for a third party to play a role. UCBI assumes that the UCMC, which has strong connections in each community, can play that third party role. Also, UCBI assumes that public art can be used in a way to reflect the modern priorities of each city, and given communities the ability to feel a sense of control or ownership over the process"
"If UCBI support series of seminars and events to provide employment search counseling and support, training on “soft” professional skills developed and conducted by Free People Employment Center to increase economic capacity of IDPs and ATO veterans in key regions, then IDPs and ATO veterans will be more independent and capable of facing challenges related to relocation and adaptation in new communities; and positive images of IDPs and ATO veterans will be formed as citizens see them playing constructive roles in their new environments."
"If UCBI supports intensive knowledge and skills workshops for local government authorities in order to raise their capacities to identify, design, and implement community development projects, then these participants will be able to demonstrate greater responsiveness to community priorities, as well as introduce new open, transparent, and inclusive approaches to governance at the local level. This should also improve the perception of local citizens about the ability of leaders to take on new mandates in the wake of municipal consolidation and the planned national decentralization of authority.  Decentralization is poorly understood by local communities, including government, civil society and constituents. This activity will increase understanding of decentralization by demonstrating the ability to respond to local prioriites.  It will also bolster linkages between government and nongovernment organizations and activist in a way that mutually benefits these sectors and the community at large by the implementation of government sponsored activities that meet community priorities.   "
"If UCBI provides opportunities for NGO “Discover Yourself ” to expand selfmotivation and knowledge among volunteers and capacity of NGOs in a field of volunteers coordination, then it will contribute to raising capacity of civic activism in Zaporizhzhia because more citizens will have opportunities to directly address community frustrations; will be provided a productive outlet to contribute to local issues they identify as priorities; will respond to clear data that indicates high levels of trust in NGOs as local change agents; and will promote unity and self sufficiency in the city. "
"If UCBI supports NGO “Gorenie” to expand proven and employ new innovate approaches to providing legal services to Ukraine's most vulnerable citizens, largely IDPs and veterans, in communities in Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts then more citizens will be able to pull themselves out of poverty, find employment and access the necessary government services.  This activity will help to professionalize and formalize legal assistance and expand its reach beyond main urban center. "
"If UCBI supports the Lviv Educational Foundation (LEF) to conduct a series of field trips, consultations and promotional campaigns in Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Mykolayiv, government controlled Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts to identify locations for expansion of its civic center communal model, then LEF will be able to deploy new civic centers that will: bolster local community activism; promote greater youth engagement in Ukrainian's transition; bolster greater transparency by building linkages between people and government; and sustain volunteerism and citizen participation in community life at the local level. LEF currently does not have the relationships necessary to expand to these communities, but both LEF and UCBI believe that there is a genuine interest among these communities that could support sustained youth engagement.  "
"If information for veterans issues and services is collected, consolidated and presented in an easy accessible web platform, not only will veterans have greater ability to access necessary services, civil society and volunteer movements will be strengthened and emboldened to help veterans. While volunteers are actively supporting veterans, there is no single effort and information about service are diffuse and difficult to find. This activity will create a national civil society leader in veterans issues.If that national leader is empowered with with information, it will be able to them influence public opinion and government policy through advocacy and outreach. There are significant societal fears, misperceptions or stereotypes about demobilized veterans. Relationships and cohesion between demobilized veterans and the rest of society are poor. Both the public and government have little idea about how to help veterans and address their issues. There are few experiences with trauma on this scale, and psychological assistance is routinely stigmatized in Ukraine."
"If UCBI provides positive opportunities for interaction between IDPs and host communities in Zaporizhzhia through children, youth and separate elder targeted activities, then it will counter stereotypes, reveal the root of existing tensions, and build longer term relationships, because during the winter there will be few opportunities for IDPhost community interaction, the majority of IDPs are families and older Ukrainians and UCBI has a test model of  productive engagement and interaction."
"If UCBI supports greater public awareness and direct services for vulnerable citizens suffering from the psychological affects of the crisis and conflict in the East, then the community will become more resilient, the vulnerable will be better able to manage challenges; families will be stronger and able to better integrate into communities; and tensions will be mitigated because the community will be better educated about mental health issues and more people will seek assistance because the stigma associated with these issues will be mitigated."
"If UCBI supports public awareness, training and monitoring to promote the implementation of procurement system ProZorro in Dnipropetrovsk then the government will be able to demonstrate it is implementing tangible reforms that greatly reduce old corrupt practices. If UCBI conducts training for government officials and the business community aimed at increased awareness of ProZorro and capacity to use the system, it will decrease skepticism about it, potentially increasing its use. This is because, the business community is skeptical that the system functions or is used by perceived corrupt officials. While corruption is one reason government does not use the system, the capacity of government and the business community to use it is also a main factor. If UCBI monitors the use of ProZorro, it will identify, and potentially eliminate corruption, creating great trust in the system since corruption remains a significant obstacle to the use and trust of ProZorro.Finally, if UCBI increases public awareness about the use and existence of ProZorro, it will improve awareness about local efforts to combat corruption. There is little general awareness about ProZorro and specific examples of its use remain unknown.Further, more small and medium sized businesses will be able to participate in a transparent tender system, promoting local economic stability, and this increased competition will also result in greater cost saving to the local budgets so more money can be leverage for the public good. Citizens will of Dnipropetrovsk be more invested and knowledgeable of public expenditures. "
"If UCBI supports the group of Ukrainian and international experts in conducting a series of training and advocacy campaign design and planning sessions for cycling advocates, public transport advocates, ecoactivists, and traffic safety groups in three major Eastern Ukrainian regions  Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia, that would lead to better preparedness and capacity of these local organizations to plan, develop, and implement stronger and more meaningful strategic communications campaigns to improve the current state of transportation, roads and public safety. The ability and strength of local safe transportation groups to strategize, design advocacy campaigns and further handle public discussion on the issue might then result in improvement of much needed local safe transportation infrastructure and healthy policies."
"If UCBI produces a series of print, photo and/or video narratives highlighting the success stories of Ukraine's postMaidan transition, it will equip local partners with information necessary to improve their morale and confidence and that of their constituents, overall creating a counter to negative perceptions and frustrations with Ukraine's transition.  There are few information sources highlighting reform and the positive roles that civil society has played in the past two years.  Stories written by renowned internationally journalists, and local opinion makers, will resonate with local activists and civil society groups. "
"If UCBI supports the development of a business incubator, including the renovation of physical space for offices, providing technical equipment, and business training programs in Melitopol targeting young entrepreneurs, it will improve opportunities for start up and grown businesses. There are few economic opportunities in Melitopol, and proreform youth are the most likely to leave. A business incubator will be unique in Melitopol  there are currently no business incubators or similar spaces in which young people can work and collaborate. Melitopol has a small but proactive group of proUkrainian, reform minded businessmen that are socially active. This incubator will build their credibility and ability to foster a great sense of civic activism and interest in pursuing small business opportunities. "
"If UCBI supports the production of a weekly television program that appeals to progressive residents of Mariupol, highlighting moderate views on reform and activist issues, the proUkraine and proreform activist community in Mariupol will be less disenfranchised and less likely to engage in unproductive forms of civic engagement.  "
"If UCBI supports the events of educating local IDP community, build the capacity of the IDP NGO, support the advocacy campaign to promote rights of IDPs and create the positive image of them in Dnipropetrovsk then IDPs will feel empowered, ready to advocate their needs, and local citizens will have more friendly attitudes to because they aim to conduct activities not only for benefit of IDPs, but also local communities."
"If UCBI supports the Cultural Community Center Shelter+ to conduct six seminars in School of Responsible Citizen, five 'get to know you' quests, twelve workshops “In the Kitchen” and twleve weekend meetings within the Shelter Welter program, then UCBI will create a cadre of local and displaced university students that drives broader youth inclusion in Kryvyi Rih. The city has a large number of displaced university students, in addition to a larger population of displaced families. Displaced and local youth have expressed a significant interest in volunteerism and  providing opportunity for social inclusion of younger children. There are few opportunities for both youth activism and social inclusion in Kryvyi Rih. Bolstering the efforts of these university students will not only support their interest in becoming active citizens, but will also promote broader social inclusion. "
"IF Better City develops a Zaporizhzhia city accountability webportal, facilitates informational and promotional outreach campaigns to educate local citizens and conducts advocacy meetings with counterparts THEN it will raise the community awareness and monitoring of public expenditures, reducing corruption , organizations and utility companies, BECAUSE there is a strong interest among Zaporizhzhia citizens, journalists and other stakeholders to be involved in decision making and getting higher level services from the  municipal government to control their efficiency, quality and deadlines, that can be expanded into a community of civic activists regarding community improvements."
"If UCBI supports the creation of an arts and culture space in Mariupol, it will enhance the profile and reach of of Mariupol's proreform arts and cultural community.  That is because there is an untapped audience who wishes to engage in progressive cultural and social trends, who are likely to support reform and Ukraine's European future.  As an entry activity, supporting this center will also buy UCBI credibility and lead to future activities with reform minded youth and activists.  "
"If UCBI supports the development  a series of workshops for local communities, land art and raion festivals, city tours for IDPs  and host community members to highlight Zaporizhzhia unique historical and cultural elements, it will help to engage people into city development, motivate them for further cooperation with each other and the local government, because both IDPs and host community will recognize their shared values and have an opportunity to interact and to change the touristic image of the city.  "
"If OTI procures a nationwide survey of various aspects of social cohesion and reconciliation, it will have the information necessary to better target its programing, eventually leading to a clear identification of the issues underpinning social cohesion in Ukraine.  No such comprehensive information exists, and is a prerequisite for further analysis and the implementation of OTI's programming.  Including a targeted survey of IDPs and a remote survey of residents within Crimea and the Occupied territories of Donbas will ensure that OTI's analysis include's recent trends and will give the program valuable insights into occupied territories and their relationships with the rest of Ukraine."
If UCBI supports NGO Wonderful and onsite activities in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia then an atmosphere of constructive social activism in selected cities will increase because the organization's experience has proved that positive examples and educational activities are able to attract and engage a broad audience. 
"If the course ""Steps toward understanding"" will be incorporated in the curriculum of high schools and spread to additional regions in the east, then high school students will be more informed, tolerant and able to resist propaganda. "
"If UCBI utilizes SCORE and has a more nuance understanding of social cohesion and resiliency dynamics in Ukraine, then the program can design more targeted, evidencebased approaches to conflict transformation and social change in its operational areas. "
"If UCBI supports the functioning of a onestop shop for IDP services in Kyiv; and builds capacity and coordination of a national civil society IDP support network made up of local civil society actors; provide business education and mentor support for IDPs in Kyiv; support advocacy training and efforts to draft and adopt IDP related legislation and policies,  then these organizations and coalitions would have a stronger public voice and improved ability to advocate the interests of IDPs because strong civil society organizations representing vulnerable groups contribute to constructive public dialog."
"IF UCBI supports the integration and service oriented activities of Mariupol THEN these groups will earn more credibility from the local community, be perceived to play a productive role in the improvement of the city, and be less likely to resort to ineffective forms of engagement BECAUSE while activists groups are frustrated, they are also energized by the opportunity to play a role in helping Mariupol address the effects of the conflict."
"If UCBI support implementation of the Dopomoga Dnipra strategic plan for 2016 aiming to expand assistance and services for IDPs resettled in Dnipropetrovsk oblast, it will reduce strain on local resources and promote social cohesion, because IDPs will be better able to integrate and function as independent members of the community.  If the organization has an a strategic plan and new skills, it will respond to integration challenges more effectively. If new facilities are built, IDPs and host community members will be given the opportunity to interact and build relationships, and if Dopomoga Dnipra is able to conduct outreach throughout the oblast, it will ensure that potential tensions and problems are not ignored."
"If UBCI supports the Student Club TAKMO in DonNUET then it will increase civic activism, awareness and the development of social responsibility among students from DonNUET including IDPs in Kryvyi Rih because the studentrun Club will promote innovative approaches to providing IDP and host community students opportunities to be engaged in their communities, creatively express themselves and contribute to social inclusion of vulnerable groups. "
"If UCBI supports local activists/artists in Dnipropetrovsk to design and implement open air community events, then these events will help residents to embrace diversity, promote community cohesion, and established a new shared urban culture because citizens, old and new, will come together in historic open spaces in the city and be exposed to urban renewal and community activism though art, multimedia, and other innovative approaches."
"IF UCBI supports NGO CentreUA to to conduct set of community assessment research, watchdog, education and advocacy activities in 10 cities of Luhansk, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts, THEN citizens will be more involved in local decision making, the oversight of local government and advocacy on reform issues which will improve local authorities' transparency, accountability, efficiency and reform implementation. BECAUSE CentreUA's activities will bolster and leverage the momentum from a growing call for citizen participation in governance and a renewed sense of Ukrainian identity.  It will also take advantage of new reforms and decentralization opportunities.  "
"If UCBI improves efficiency and transparency for  drivers license and vehicle registration services on the part of the national government in four pilot centers in Kyiv, then citizen perceptions that threaten community cohesion, as well as widely held perceptions of corruption, will be reduced and community resilience will be bolstered. Citizens will likewise have a tangible example of government reform which will improve the perceptions of citizens about the government.  "
"If UCBI empowers moderate voices for veterans to provide opportunities for veterans to advocate for improved service delivery, then veteran grievances will be reduced and the potential for the radicalization of society minimized, because veterans would feel a greater stake in political processes advocated by a moderate, respected organization."
"IF UCBI helps Mariupol Civic Military Cooperation (CIMIC) with NGO Novy Mariupol and local village authorities to renovate public services damaged in the conflictTHEN key civil society and government stakeholders (CMIC) and UCBI will build trust and relationships between residents of contact line communities in Southern Donetsk necessary to ensure those communities are included in Ukrainian political and social life.BECAUSE these communities are difficult to reach for civil society, and the local CMIC has little to offer to resolve their most pressing issues, furthering feelings of isolation, abandonment and resentment among these communities.  Partnering these organizations to address these needs, will build relationships and allow all parties to identify avenues for future programming.  "
"IF UCBI supports the Lviv Educational Foundation (LEF) to conduct a number of volunteer field camps and hold a School of Responsible Citizenship for the most active volunteers, THEN a key demographic will be equipped with the tools and experience to connect with a modern Ukrainian identity by participating in local community activism and engagement in Ukraine's transition.  The support built by the service trips will also help LEF to deploy new civic centers in the future.  BECAUSE, while support for Ukrainian identity and civic engagement is growing, there are few opportunities for youth to engage with it in small communities in the east.  Providing tangible opportunities to participate in civic activism or to improve communities, and connect with like minded youth, will help to bridge that gap.  "
"IF UCBI provides technical equipment, furniture, training and software to open the Mariupol ASC, THEN residents of this important and divided city will have improved perceptions of local government's ability to deliver services in an efficient and transparent way BECAUSE, the opening of the ASC will be a highly visible, symbolic indication of a new approach to governmentcitizen relations, it will be used by up to half of the city's residents in its first year, and will deliver services quickly and without corruption.  "
"IF UCBI implements 12 advocacy campaigns aimed at improved local transportation, conducts outreach and training for new transportation advocacy organizations in three Donbas cities and provides opportunities for networking and integration into national transportation advocacy networks, THEN the program will demonstrate, popularize and expand productive forms of civic engagement around a key issue in Eastern Ukraine.  BECAUSE the state of transportation is a rallying point where activists can successfully advocate for change because of decentralization and has a broad appeal and high likelihood to result in popular improvements and to create modern European style urban infrastructure.  "
"IF UCBI supports the two day Donbas Media Forum for 240 media practitioners to discuss the methods for overcoming the informational blockade on the occupied and liberated territories THEN new media outlets will have greater capacity and credibility to deliver of critical information and increase level of audience's confidence in Ukrainian media and the country's transition.  BECAUSE these independent journalists have questionable professional standards, low brand awareness and poor marketing skills and experience which will be improved through the the master classes, discussions and marketing/promotion of the conference.  "
"If UCBI supports the creation of technical facilities to broadcast meetings of Dnipropetrovsk City Council commissions and plenary sessions, then it will increase transparency of local city government because the activity will establish regular, publiclyavailable online broadcasts, including video archives of the meetings of Dnipropetrovsk City Council commissions, plenary sessions; and local activists and journalists will be able to observe decision making meetings about issues that might be subject to corruption, and block decisions which cause conflicts of interest.  "
"If UCBI supports NGO Wonderful and onsite activities in Mariupol, Severodonetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro then an atmosphere of constructive social activism in selected cities will increase because the organization's experience has proved that positive examples and educational activities are able to attract and engage a broad audience."

"If we engage youth in Majdel Anjar and surroundings in community service projects, dialogue forums, and outreach activities, then we will help strengthen a moderate youth platform in a major Salafist stronghold because youth in this area have few alternatives to activities and services provided by Salafist movements. "
"If we engage vulnerable youth in conflict zones of Tripoli in joint activities, then we will increase connectedness between rival community groups because positive interactions between Sunnis and Alawites in this area are rare, opening the door to foster greater communal understanding and cooperation."
"If we engage Lebanese and Syrian youth in solving needs and doing common activities, then we will increase positive interactions between the host community and refugee population because youth are both the main drivers of tensions and also have the greatest potential to act as peace agents if given the opportunity to play a constructive role in their community."
"If we generate research data on citizen perceptions and attitudes towards critical drivers of tension and extremism, then we will enhance the effectiveness, efficiency as well as the timeliness of program activities and resources, because the information generated will help identify priority regions and interventions, and enhance the strategic design and targeting of activities "
"If we engage Lebanese and Syrian youth of different political viewpoints in joint activities and community service, then we will reduce politically motivated tensions between them because rival parties tend to fuel incitement among youth exploiting their differences and isolating them from each other therefore by increasing positive interaction we will help youth relate to each other positively and identify with each other making them less vulnerable to political exploitation. "
"If we engage Lebanese youth of diverse political and sectarian backgrounds in joint cultural, sports, and dialogue activities involving the broader community, then we will increase the connectedness between different sectarian groups in Hermel, Qa'a and Ras Baalbeck because youth and residents of these areas have few opportunities to interact positively due to growing mistrust, mutual accusations, and polarization tied to spillover of the Syrian conflict, making them vulnerable to political manipulation and potential mobilization to take up arms and engage in sectarian clashes or acts of vigilantism. "
"If we support youth from Mina's poorest areas in delivering tangible benefits to their communities, then we will decrease their vulnerability to extremism and violence because constructive engagement and recognition of their efforts by the community will give them a sense of purpose and motivate them to continue playing a positive role through civic activities. "
"If we organize a peaceful cultural event in an area perceived as dangerous and controlled by extremists, then we will change people's perception that these areas are accessible to them and that they have ownership over these spaces because: 1) people want a sense of ownership over these spaces. 2) the reason people aren't using the space or taking ownership is out of fear rather than sectarian issues or political issues. 3) they don't have organized activities to help reclaim the space. 4) other actors have not been neutral and have tried to claim space based on their sectarian and political agendas."
"If we engage youth of diverse sectarian backgrounds in joint community service and peacebuilding initiatives in an area with rising SunniShiite tensions due to the Syrian conflict, then we will decrease sectarian tensions and prevent them from reaching a boiling point because: 1) there is a lack of joint activities and positive interactions between Sunni and Shiite youth in this tense region. 2) extremist elements and actors that benefit from the sectarian tensions discourage such interactions. 3) Sunni and Shiite residents of these areas have mutual fears of each other, which leads to mistrust and lack of interaction.  4) local residents have historically cohabited in the Beqaa region and want to rebuild trust between their respective communities.

"
"By expanding and supporting a public space that was previously controlled by extremist groups, local merchants, customers, and residents will benefit from increased access and use of the space and will therefore own and protect the space because:1) limited access to the space hurts their livelihoods2) if we show people that they benefit from a moderate space, they will keep the extremists away."
"If we increase the citizenship knowledge (being part of a community/society/nation) and practices of youth who are vulnerable to being attracted to extreme ideologies, then we will increase their sense of belonging and responsibility towards their community because youth who do not have a sense of belonging are more vulnerable to being recruited into violent extremist groups.  "
"If we use social media and public outreach platforms to increase youth awareness of the impact of their behavior on others, then they will understand what is socially acceptable behavior of selfexpression because youth who are continually exposed to violent behavior replicate this behavior without understanding the serious impact/consequences of this behavior as they think it is normal."
"If we build the capacity of youth leaders to design and implement conflict prevention initiatives, then we will strengthen local mechanisms to resolve conflict and promote peaceful alternatives to violence because: 1) peacebuilding units led by youth leaders will be accepted as credible conflict mitigation platforms; 2) sectarian tensions and conflicts are not being adequately addressed due to weak local mechanisms for conflict mitigation."
"If we engage marginalized youth in constructive community activities and public events, then we will increase their capacity to play a positive role in their communities because the lack of avenues and opportunities for community engagement contribute to a sense of powerlessness and disillusionment among youth, making them vulnerable to extremist recruitment. "
"If we use interactive theater as a tool to bring youth leaders from rival communities together in an area with escalating sectarian tensions, then we will decrease the likelihood that those tensions may degenerate into intercommunal conflict because:1) joint activities built on positive interactions between the two communities are rare in this area and is the reason for limited interaction between these youth2) Sunni and Shiite youth from Aarsal and Laboueh lack the skills and knowledge for non violent expression 3) youth leaders can influence perceptions in their respective communities and act as voices of peace"
"If we create platforms for youth from different sectarian groups to peacefully engage with each other then we will increase positive interaction between these youth because: (1) increased interaction will decrease the polarization of sectarian groups(2) there are active youth in these communities but they have few opportunities to coordinate actions across confessional lines(3) joint activities that meet common needs will increase positive interactions between sectarian groups, which will improve perceptions and acceptance of each other because youth who don't interact are more likely to have negative perceptions of each other"
"If we bring Lebanese and refugee youth together to identify and address priority issues, then we will build the capacities of these groups to find common ground and joint solutions to their problems because: 1) Lebanese citizens and refugees rarely interact outside formal working relationships and are isolated from one another2) Lebanese citizens and refugees want to solve the problems which affect both of their communities but lack opportunities to do so"
"If we support the LDO in rehabilitating the fish market and increase its visibility as a moderate actor, then we will prevent extremists groups from exploiting the grievances of local vendors and their families because: 1) extremist groups exploit social and economic grievances to gain influence in vulnerable communities2) lack of action and solutions by government entities increase resentment of the state, providing a fertile ground for extremist groups to attract recruits3). communities will align themselves with extremist groups if they can respond to their needs"
"If we support  a moderate youth group in conducting community projects and public events in strategic public spaces, then we  will increase its visibility and credibility in the community because:(1) when given the option, youth will chose to play a moderate and positive role in their communities.(2) youth want to play a leadership role in the community but have lacked the resources, training and opportunity to do so.(3) when others see that youth can play a positive role in the community and they can benefit from their increased involvement in the community, they will gain respect and credibility in the community."
"If we increase the capacity of a moderate civil society coalition in Aarsal, then they will more effectively counter negative messages and perceptions of Aarsal because moderate actors want to play a role in changing people's perceptions of Aarsal but do not have the resources or technical ability to effectively take on this significant challenge."
"If we support a moderate actor in mobilizing the community to rehabilitate public areas once controlled by extremists, then we will expand moderate space and increase community ownership of the space because: 1) recent events have created a vacuum that, if not filled by moderate forces, will be filled by extremist groups. 2) communities benefit more from moderate space than extremist space and therefore will take ownership over the space3) with increased ownership of the space, the community will prevent the area from being used by extremists in the future "
"If we rehabilitate a mixed market in Jabal Mohsen and Tebbaneh communities, then we will reinforce joint ownership over the space because:1) extremist elements will attempt to create tensions in this space during Ramadan2) local residents and civic actors will seek to protect the space after seeing the benefits of reclaiming this space3) civic actors and local residents want to reclaim the space but have lacked the resources to do so"
"If we engage Lebanese and Syrian youth in constructive community activities in an area with a heavy presence of extremists, then we will reduce their vulnerability to recruitment into extremist groups because: (1) a feeling of not belonging to the community is a reason why youth are joining extremist groups.(2) If youth are given the skills to play a positive role in their community, they will be given more credibility and respect and therefore have a greater sense of belonging to their  communities. (3) Extremist groups target both Lebanese and Syrian youth due to common grievances among both groups.(4) It is the civic education skills and opportunities which are preventing both the Lebanese and Syrian youth residing in this area to constructively  engage and participate in the community. . "
"If we bring youth from rival communities together over an extended period of time, then we will break down social barriers and increase positive interactions between them because youth from these areas want to interact but are prevented from doing so due to the isolation imposed on them by current events. "
"If we establish a youth center in a town facing rising extremism and that lacks nonpartisan public spaces, then we will provide an opportunity for local youth to take ownership of a moderate space that will provide them with alternatives to extremism through access to regular activities shaped by the youth themselves because: 1) youth in Aarsal lack avenues and platforms to make their voices heard and participate in constructive activities2) local youth want opportunities to interact positively and play a positive role in their troubled community 3) if operated properly and in a participatory way, the youth center will increase the visibility of a moderate civic actor in an area infiltrated by extremist groups"
"If we engage both Lebanese and Syrian youth in an increasingly difficult context of mutual hostility, isolation and discrimination, then we will increase positive interactions between both community groups because: 1) Lebanese and Syrians rarely interact outside formal working relationships2) Youth are open to positive interactions if provided with safe platforms to do so 3) Youth can influence others in their community to reduce hostility "
"If we involve moderate civic groups in organizing a sports tournament in Qoubbe during Ramadan, then we will increase their reach and visibility among vulnerable youth and communities infiltrated by extremists because: 1) Youth and local residents look to participate in community events during the month of Ramadan, and will be attracted to a sports tournament2) Extremist groups will intensify their recruitment and indoctrination efforts during Ramadan, therefore if moderate actors can engage youth in activities they enjoy, youth will be less available and less likely to be attracted to extremist groups. 3) Soccer is the most popular sport among vulnerable youth and the tournament will encourage more youth to join the moderate actors supported by OTI4) Moderate actors are willing to work together but lack the resources and platform to do so.  "
"If we engage youth in constructive community activities in an area with a heavy presence of extremists, then we will reduce their vulnerability to recruitment into extremist groups because: (1) Youth are joining extremist groups to find a sense of belonging as they do not have this sense of belonging within the community.(2) The community does not respect youth as potential positive contributures and this is a contributing factor to youth joining extremist groups; therefore if they are recognized and respected by the community they will be less likely to join extremist groups.(3) It is the lack of civic participation skills and opportunities that are preventing youth residing in this area to constructively engage and participate in the community."
"If we engage Lebanese and Syrian youth in addressing common needs in an area with escalating tensions, then we will decrease the likelihood that those tensions may degenerate into conflict because:1) joint activities built on positive interactions between the two communities are rare in this area2) Syrian and Lebanese youth have few platforms for nonviolent selfexpression 3) youth leaders can influence perceptions in their respective communities and act as voices of peace"
"If we support a moderate actor to conduct community activities and spread positive messages in a place where extremism is on the rise, then we will increase moderate space because: (1) moderate actors want to play a positive counterbalancing role in communities but lack the resources and platforms to do so.(2) when provided an option people will choose moderate rather than radical or extreme leaders(3) local youth want to increase moderate space but lack the resources and platforms to do so "
"If we support civic actors in engaging the community in visible actions during Ramadan, then we will increase the reach and visibility of moderate actors to counter the appeal of extremist groups because:1) Recruitment efforts by extremist groups will increase during Ramadan2) Ramadan provides an opportunity for broad community and youth mobilization in public areas3) Aarsal residents and youth want to challenge the control and influence of extremist groups but lack collective platforms to do so "
"If we engage youth from two competing sports clubs that are prone to violence and political manipulation in highly visible sports and community activities during Ramadan, then we will foster positive interactions and constructive collaboration between them because they want to collaborate and Ramadan provides an opportunity to amplify the impact of the previous grant (LCRI028). "
"If we bring together religious leaders to discuss youth recruitment into violent extremism in the North, then we will gauge the capacity and political will of these leaders to address the issue because:1) religious leaders will work together to address a common issue even if they don't have the same beliefs2) religious leaders want to play a role in reducing youth vulnerability to extremist recruitment, but have not done so because they lack the capacities, skills, resources and organization"
"If we involve vulnerable youth in mobilizing communities around joyful Ramadanrelated public events, then we will empower them to play a visible role that will increase their sense of belonging and reduce the appeal of extremist groups because: 1) vulnerable youth (unemployed/low education levels) lack a sense of belonging to their communities, which makes them susceptible to recruitment into extremist groups2) empowering youth to play a visible role and get recognized by the community will increase their sense of belonging 3) joyful public events will counter the indoctrination efforts and religious austerity imposed by extremist groups, which are expected to intensify during Ramadan"
"If we promote  stories of civic engagement and positive aspects of marginalized areas in the North and Beqaa which have been viewed as controlled by extremists and losing their Lebanese identity , then we will help change the negative perceptions and reduce the marginalization and isolation of these areas, because (1) the recent events have masked the traditional character and Lebanese identity of these areas and (2) because positive change and  civic initiatives would change people's prevailing perceptions of these areas if they received media coverage and were relayed to the wider public and (3) because the increased marginalization of these areas is becoming a self fulfilling prophecy;leaving a fertile ground for extremists groups and radical ideologies to further exploit the narrative of marginalization to gain new recruits.  "
"If we engage youth from Tripoli conflict zones in joint Ramadan activities that involve the broader community, then we will increase positive interactions between Sunnis and Alawites because: 1) There are few platforms for positive interactions between these communities2) Ramadan provides an opportunity for joint engagement 3) Extremist groups exploit sectarian divisions to serve radical agendas, and will intensify extremist rhetoric during Ramadan "
"If we tell a different story of Tripoli which is different from the perception of a place overtaken by extremists, then we will challenge the current negative perception that Tripoli is a city overtaken by extremist elements because:1) negative perceptions are leading to marginalization of Tripoli and its residents, which traditionally was not the case.2) negative perceptions are based on current events rather than traditional beliefs or perceptions of Tripoli."
"If we broadly publicize the friendships, collaboration, and common stories of atrisk Sunni and Alawite youth from vulnerable areas of Tripoli, then we will counter negative stereotypes of these areas as hotbeds of sectarian violence and extremism because: 1) Most Lebanese harbor negative stereotypes due to lack of knowledge about the realities of life in Tripoli's marginalized neighborhoods2) Youth in these neighborhoods lack platforms to make their voices heard and are heavily manipulated by political and extremist forces, which speak for them "
"If we conduct field research around the drivers and dynamics of radicalization among youth in the most vulnerable areas, then we will better counter recruitment and radicalization strategies in Lebanon because understanding how and why extremists narratives resonate with Lebanese youth will help enhance the targeting and design of CVE interventions and communication messages. "
"Theory of Change: If we strengthenlinkages between moderate actors, then we will reinforce jointownership over the space because:1)extremist elements will attempt to create tensions in this space during Ramadan2)local residents and civic actors will seek to protect the space after seeingthe benefits of reclaiming this space3) civic actors andlocal residents want to reclaim the space but have lacked the resources to doso"
"If we support common activities between Jabal Mohsen, Tebbaneh, and Qoubbe during Ramadan, then we will increase positive interactions between Alawites and Sunnis in vulnerable Tripoli communities prone to sectarian violence because: 1) These communities want to interact peacefully but have been manipulated by political interests and violent extremist groups2) These communities would plan common peaceful activities but lack opportunities and platforms 3) Ramadan provides an opportunity for joyful, peaceful interactions and broad community mobilization, and is also a time when extremist groups are expected to intensify youth recruitment efforts, hence the need to counter those efforts through positive youth engagement "
"If we support a moderate actor in organizing movie screenings in public areas that were once controlled by extremists, then we will expand moderate space and increase community ownership of the space because: 1) recent events have created a vacuum that, if not filled by moderate forces, will be filled by extremist groups. 2) communities benefit more from moderate space than extremist space and therefore will take ownership over the space.3) with increased ownership of the space, the community will prevent the area from being used by extremists in the future."
"If we support an active scouts movement to engage additional youth in constructive community activities, then we will increase the the reach and visibility of a moderate local actor in an area prone to radicalization and extremism because moderate actors want to play a role in preventing youth recruitment but do not have the resources or platform to do so.  "

Civic initiatives/actions increase youth sense of belonging to their community3. Visible/tangible actions of benefit to the larger community decrease the marginalization of youth as these actions create recognition for them4. Participating youth can inspire other youth in following productive/positive engagement in communities"

"If we develop further the reporting skills of the ACSC youth and help them establish themselves as a reference in reporting accurate local news that promote real and positive aspects of Aarsal, then we will counter the negative portrayal of the media and reduce the marginalization of the area because:1) increased isolation and marginalization of Aarsal is being used by extremist groups to expand their influence and manipulate sectarian tensions2) countering the stereotypes spread by the media will help lessen the incitement of the general public and change their perceptions 3) youth of Aarsal want to relay a different and positive image of their town but they were never given the support and the space to share their own views and realities  "
"If we train vulnerable youth in cyber recruitment awareness, critical thinking and peaceful expression, then we will increase their awareness of manipulation tactics, reduce their vulnerability to recruitment and enhance their capacity for a positive response because:1) youth don't want to be recruited by extremists but lack the understanding that they are being manipulated 2) youth want to respond positively but don't have the needed skills and platforms"

"
" If we engage Syrians and Lebanese in joint community projects in Tarik El Jdide then we will expand the opportunities for civic engagement and positive interaction because(1) both Syrians and Lebanese would prefer to use peaceful methods to resolve community problems but lack the capacity, leaderhip and networks to do so (2) Syrians do not want to be seen as a burden to their host community and would like to help find solutions to community tensions (3)Increased sense of community engagement and achievement will encourage youth to adopt civic and peaceful alternatives instead of political ones which fuel tensions and polarization"

"If we link USAID/OTI local partners, transfer to them online outreach skills and help them use and leverage the LiveLoveBeirut  platform then we will increase the capacity of our partners to strategically use social media to promote the positive aspects of their regions because   (1) most of our local partners lack the skills, strategy and tools to expand their reach and visibility (2) capitalizing on one existing and widely used platform will amplify the impact of individual positive initiatives (3) bringing various partners together and discussing challenges, needs and visions of the different regions will help us better leverage the ongoing fragmented efforts and design a more strategic outreach."
"If we launch a competition in different universities across Lebanon and support youth in producing and promoting information products with positive messages, then we will increase youth contribution in countering the sectarian discourse prevalent on social media and oncampuses because (1) tensions are often the result of negative perceptions and narratives promoted by political parties rather than facts (2) university campuses are politically tense environments where sectarian rhetoric and incitement are used to fuel tensions and attract youth to political blocks  (3) university students are important drivers of change and have the capacity and the potential to influence perceptions and disseminate messages on offline and online platforms "

"If  we engage Lebanese and Syrian youth in jointly providing tangible solutions for their communities affected by the garbage crisis then we will increase cooperation and positive interaction between the two groups because 1) the garbage crisis has motivated people to take action and develop community based solutions in the absence of government resolution of the issue, thus increasing the probability that Syrians and Lebanese will cooperate together despite current tensions between the  two groups. 2) Syrians do not want to be viewed as a burden to host communities and therefore will want to participate in the activity to change perceptions that Syrians could be also part of the solution."
"If we engage youth in Tariq El Jdideh in community development and provide tangible benefits for their community, then we will increase their sense of empowerment and their trust in the effectiveness of civil society actors because:(1) people's affiliation to political, radical or civic groups increases with the perceived benefits from these groups (2) giving youth a role in the decisionmaking and implementation of a visible community project will provide them with a benefit that is more attractive to them than what is offered by extremists groups   (3) Tariq El Jdideh lacks major contributions/success stories from civil society actors, thus providing tangibles will increase the interest of youth in civic engagement.  "
"If we engage youth of diverse sectarian backgrounds in joint assessment of common concerns in an area with rising SunniShiite tensions due to the Syrian conflict, then we will increase positive interaction between the youth and contribute to preventing tensions from reaching a boiling point because: 1) Sunni and Shiite youth want to interact together but do not due to the lack of joint activities and skills to promote interactions between Sunni and Shiite youth in this tense region. 2) youth do not see that they have issues of common concern and if they realize this it will promote greater understanding and foster a rapprochement between them. 3) Sunni and Shiite residents of these areas have mutual fears of each other, which leads to mistrust and lack of interaction.

Assumptions:  The context in which civil society operates today in Macedonia is decidedly worse than a decade ago. The civil society sector in Macedonia is confronted by many challenges related to its operation, development, and survival. Groups that seek government accountability, advocate for rights, or seek to provide independent oversight of government and party activity find themselves harassed, sued, and demonized.

"Problem: Significant efforts to disparage and degrade the Special Prosecutor's Office and its members (SPO) make this important institution vulnerable and put its authority and mandate at risk. TOC: IF MSI provides technical support to the SPO through a strategic communications advisor THEN the SPO will be better able to communicate its role, activities, and successes to citizens and media BECAUSE: The majority of media coverage on SPO is negative and the office has limited capacity to counteract it Negative press and lack of objective information suppresses citizen interest in and appreciation of importance of SPO Amplification of efforts to advocate and disseminate objective information will counteract influence of negative press"
"IF citizens are better informed about nonviolent, multiethnic means of voicing their concerns about the democratic deficiencies in Macedonia, THEN more citizens will be empowered to take ownership of their own political agency and will be better placed to advocate for transparency and good governance in the country. Assumptions:  If protests continue, fueled by governmentbacked counterprotests and vitriolic reporting in the media, there is a real threat that violence will escalate Encouraging and providing opportunities for Macedonians to engage in a constructive, nonviolent way will ensure a more participatory movement calling for transparency and good governance.

"IF we develop a unifying promotional campaign for MSI activities and local partners from across the political sprectrum, THEN we will broaden and strengthen their messages and impact.BECAUSE: Coordinated and consistent messaging and branding is more compelling than numerous individual brandsMSI partners and activities do not independently have the capacity to develop such networks on their own"
"IF MSI produce thirty (30), thirtyminute satirical news programs THEN we will expose citizens to a diversity of viewpoints.

"IF MSI supports multimedia and social media training and produces and publicizes multimedia work created by the participants on important issues, THEN there will be increased civic awareness BECAUSE:Citizens will be empowered to affect social change throughout their communities by expressing, discussing, and seeking solutions to issues important to them. The conventional media space is coopted, influenced by powerful political parties, and shrinking, citizens of Macedonia must be presented with an alternative, open space in which to engage in nonpartisan dialogue. "
"IF MSI produces and broadcasts twentytwo documentaries highlighting Macedonia's multicultural heritage, THEN citizens will be exposed to a diversity of viewpointsBECAUSE: The lack of content on Macedonian media about the country's cultural diversity contributes to the perpetuation of polarizing nationalistic narratives.

That our target group, individuals between 1845, are consuming news primarily via internet web portals and that this 13 minute format will fill an information gap for that target group. "
"IF we support OXO animated short videos that will call attention to voter irregularities and political pressure tactics, THEN citizens will be exposed to issues of voter fraud and will be better informed citizens about their electoral rights, BECAUSE:We assume that not all Macedonians recognize that these practices are antithetical to a vibrant democratic system of governance."
"Problem: Citizens lack factbased, objective information about local and national issues because the media landscape is dominated by biased and simplistic programming and reporting.By supporting the production of six, 8 to 15minutee investigative journalism documentaries, THEN MSI will expose citizen to balanced information and diversity of viewpoints BECAUSEMacedonians would consume balanced journalism if it existed Nonpartisian investigative journalism doesn't get aired on mainstream media outletsInvestigative journalism introduces critical thinking and differing perspectives about important societal issues"
"IF MSI conducts two polls during the pre and post electoral period then MSI will provide the Macedonian public with public opinion data BECAUSE  currently there is a dearth of independent, credible opinion polling about on Macedonian public perceptions for the upcoming national elections in December 2016 and local elections in February 2017 "
"If MSI supports targeted research and analysis, then USG will be better informed to design and implement targeted strategies and effective activities to prevent and counter violent extremism in Macedonia."
"IF citizens implement grassroots activities in their communities, THEN citizens will realize their potential and ability to impact the world around themBECAUSE: A significant proportion of Macedonians do not engage civically because there are limited opportunities to do so in a constructive way Citizens feel their individual efforts are futile Citizens are not aware of other efforts or desires to bring about changes in their communities. There is a lack of positive models of public participation in civic activities in communities throughout Macedonia. Citizens will be more motivated to engage on local issues that directly affect their lives."
"If we produce a drama series (45 episodes) with diverse narratives, THEN a greater number of viewers would be exposed and have access to new and diverse media content on issues important to Macedonians BECAUSE:Macedonian's media environment lacks plurality, diverse perspectives, and vetted facts that would provide them with the necessary information to make informed Macedonians prefer to view locally produce content and series that they can relate to more directly rather than the Turkish soap operas that currently saturate the market.  Entertainment media, including drama series can be social influencers that engage audiences, introduces new or different ideas or perspectives on an issue, and empower citizens to think more critically  within their sociopolitical space.The drama series have shown relative success at reaching audiences there is an opportunity to improve the content and expand its viewership."
"If we enable local actors to use creative techniques and carry out transformative actions then local citizens would have additional opportunities to be more proactive in a less intimidating way and raise awareness on issues of importance to their community because current options to participate and engage are seen as partisan, unappealing and not relevant for most citizens in local communities. "
"If we support the production of TV debate segments airing during the weekday nightly news program, THEN a broader audience of Macedonian citizens will have access to representations of diverse viewpoints on critical issues.Because we assume:That representing diverse viewpoints on critical issues will attract an audience of Macedonians across the political spectrum to watch the Kanal 5 weekday nightly news programThat some other TV and media outlets are not representing a diversity of viewpoints to inform Macedonian citizens on critical issuesThat Macedonian citizens are interested in watching a TV debate show that represents different viewpoints on critical issues. "
"If selected MSI partners receive digital and operational security trainings and digital equipment, THEN MSI key partners will have enhanced behavioral and security practices and will be able to withstand digital and operation challenges BECAUSE:Disinformation campaigns and evolving digital security threats target journalists and civil society organizations, including MSI partners, which reduces their ability to deliver value to constitutes MSI partners currently lack knowledge and opportunities to develop digital and operational security skillsMSI partners are interested and able to improve their security practices and protocols "
"If we augment the production capacity and broadcasts of an already wellresearched and nonpartisan debatebased news show on a primarily Albanian language TV station, with Macedonian language episodes and online outreach, then a broader audience of Macedonia's citizens will have access to more balanced and moderate information at a critical time.  We assume the predominant use of the Albanian language of the TV station and current level of online outreach are key constraints on the reach of TV21 viewership and that Macedonian citizens are interested in watching a model of more objective television programming. "
"IF MSI supports the increase of diverse, high quality content that follows professional journalistic standards in the digital media space that is available to the Macedonian public THEN the reach and engagement of diverse, high quality content, that follows professional journalistic standards, in the digital media space will expand,BECAUSE we assume that: Independent media entities currently do not have the capacity to produce large volumes of diverse, objective and highly professional journalistic content. Given the limited supply of accurate and objective journalistic content, the reach of relevant news information, and the engagement around it, is also limited.  There is massive amount of false information presented in the Macedonian media landscape, and there is value in demonstrating to the public the existence of those false information, and providing to them accurate, objective and truthful information. Due to the strong polarization of the media, the viewpoints of many citizens are unrepresented in the current media landscape. "

"If we develop the first season of the “Insider” drama series, THEN the show will represent diverse narratives on issues of importance for Macedonian citizens BECAUSE:The ""Insider"" series will air on Telma and be viewed by Macedonian audiences during the fall season. Macedonian's media environment lacks plurality, diverse perspectives, and vetted facts that would provide them with the necessary information to make informed Macedonians prefer to view locally produced content and series that they can relate to more directly rather than the international soap operas that currently saturate the market.  Entertainment media, including drama series can be social influencers that engage audiences, introduce new or different ideas or perspectives on an issue, and empower citizens to think more critically within their sociopolitical space.Drama series have shown relative success in reaching audiences in Macedonia and there is an opportunity to improve the content and expand viewership of these types of series.Drama series provide a format for representing diverse narratives on issues of importance. "
"Theory of Change: If the second phase of a national public awareness campaign in support of the MYF civic engagement campaign is implemented, then exposure to local level civic participation will expand.BECAUSE: Currently there is a lack of awareness of the MYF Campaign and opportunities for civic action in target areas outside of Skopje.  The second phase of the campaign will target these areas outside of Skopje.There are limited tangible opportunities to engage civically. Traditionally, citizens are apathetic about or afraid to actively participate in their community. This awareness campaign provides the overarching branding and messaging for all MYF activities (implemented under separate agreements) and it is a critical component to unify disparate civic action activities. Creating a shared platform for sending the message Move Your Finger is more compelling than numerous individual brands. Exposure to alternative and positive ways to engage on key issues will be compelling to a wider group of citizens across the country."
" IF MSI provides expertise in organizational management to the SPO through a expert legal advisor THEN the SPO will improve the overall functionality of the entity BECAUSE:   Management challenges have the potential of significantly delaying and hindering the SPO's capacity to enact its mandate   If the SPO's capacity is improved, there is a greater possibility for the SPO to fulfill its role as outlined in the Prizno AgreementIf equipped with better work flow processes and organizational management tools, the SPO will be enable to empower its teams to take on more responsibilities "
"IF:  We support grassroots initiatives that transform public spaces, THEN:  more citizens will participate in inclusive, nonpartisan opportunities that identify and address issues of local concernBECAUSE we assume that:  National and local institutions do not solicit input from citizens in decisionmaking processes for urban development Citizens have previously expressed concern about controversial decisions by public institutions to develop urban spaces Citizens are not offered proactive opportunities to be involved in decisionmaking or addressing issues related to public spaces Citizens are more likely to engage around local issues that affect their daily lives."
"IF we produce and publish a new genre of photojournalism stories that present factbased, balanced information, THEN we will inform citizens' viewpoints on important issues, BECAUSE we assume:That this new genre will be appealing to a wide variety of citizens;That this new format of stories, currently not available on other media outlets, provides an accessible and appealing medium to communicate alternative perspectives;That producing and publishing this new genre and presenting factbased, balanced information will attract a wider audience;That the stories produced by this activity will be easily viewed by an audience both on social media and other internet sites; andThat currently citizens' viewpoints are informed by sources that do not present balanced, factbased information."
"If district profiles are developed for Bardheere and Diinsoor Districts, then SSI can better identify local needs and support for more targeted and effective stabilization interventions, because SSI will have a better understanding of the political, social and security realities in its target areas. "
"If community members have an opportunity to contact a dedicated number and provide feedback on SSI activities, then  SSI will be able to adapt the program both by taking remedial action against any issues raised and refine the scope, focus and approach of activities in future,  because it will have greater visibility on the progress of and community reaction to its projects."
If SSI conducts research of the datacollection and telecommunication service providers available in Somalia then the SSI program will be able to better design projects that communicate with isolated communities as it will have a better understanding of the spectrum of the tools available to it.
"If SSI/Dalbile provides the SMT and program with coordination and context support during the contract period, then there will be an increase in the depth and breadth of Dalbile activities because the program needs extra support so it can improve its programming. "
"If SSI/Dalbile carries out research on existing governance and leadership training curricula, produces a tailored curriculum for training local government officials in JSS and SWS, conducts a ToT on the curriculum / training and evaluation of the ToT and conducts a followup survey/ interview 36 months after the training (post training reinforcement), THEN this will ensure all governance and leadership training activities are standard and in line with a curriculum for the SSI/Dalbile program BECAUSE there is currently inconsistent application of good governance and leadership curriculum that have previously resulted in misinformation exacerbated lack of qualified trainers."
"If SSI/Dalbile provides MOPIC with technical assistance to support the finalization and harmonization of a policy framework for NGOs in Somalia, an action plan to rollout the policy, and a technical workshop to discuss findings and socialize the policy then this will improve the understanding among federal and state government officials of best practices on legal frameworks for NGOs and increase MoPIC's confidence and ability in conducting effective consultations with the NGO community because there are concerns that if ineffective regulation is implemented, it would slow recovery, inhibit growth, and undermine efforts to advance Somalia's development agendas expressed in the National Development Plan."
"If a trauma awareness workshop is held for 60 community, women and political leaders from JSS and SWS (focus will be made to those from SSI target areas), as well as conduct an evaluation of the impact of the program's activities on direct participants using data captured with an innovative mobile application system, then this will increase the participant's knowledge of the impact of stress and trauma in their own lives and to support them in finding appropriate coping skills as well as inform follow up trauma awareness activities because the effects of trauma are not well understood, recognised or  considered and therefore, rarely addressed especially by key leaders in the community."
"If SSI/Dalbile conducts research on local VE Drivers in JSS & SWS, then we will improve/strengthen the quality of SSI/Dalbile programming , because there is currently no indepth research or information about VE drivers and the program is not able to access areas under AS control in order to understand the context."
"If SSI conducts a land issues and disputes mapping along the Jubba Valley area through secondary research and fieldwork in Kismayo and Dadaab/Kakuma (Kenya), then this will increase SSI's understanding of existing land issues and disputes in Jubba Valley in anticipation of Jubba Valley liberation, because once AS leaves, there will be a vacuum that could cause land tensions, therefore the program needs to know existing tensions before implementing any activities in the region."
"If SSI/Dalbile facilitates a fiveday National Consultation Conference on conflict, reconciliation and peace in Somalia, then all the stakeholders will jointly identify and understand reconciliation needs that would require future intervention responses, because they currently lack of understanding of the causes and issues of the conflict, who are the stakeholders and conflict dynamics which has often resulted in a failure of peacebuilding efforts in the past.

"If VISTAS provides interactive assessment and monitoring tools to resource facilitators for the MS pilot phase, then qualitative and quantitive information will be gathered allowing for monitoring of MS activities, because: the tools will enable participatory data collection by RFs and community members the tools will enable the capturing/recording of videos, pictures and statements during MS sessions the tools will enable on spot recording and capturing participants feedback"
"If Morning Star conducts two sets of twoweek trainings for resource facilitators, then resource facilitators will be able to successfully pilot the Morning Star program at field level, because:oIt will give the RFs a stronger technical background in trauma (TICE) and instruction in the Morning Star materialsoIt will provide the RFs targeted assignments to start field implementation, including - in view of this being a pilot - specific aspects of the materials to focus on for evaluating local suitability and methodology. OThe trainings link to a series of inkind grants which cover material support and stipends for resource facilitators and their organizations which support them to complete the work"
"If Morning Star conducts one 6 day trainings for resource facilitators and one 10 day training for community facilitators each, then resource facilitators will be able to successfully pilot Morning Star program at community level, because: The RFs and CFs will have a strong technical background in TICE and Morning Star materials that will enable them to successfully manage community discussions."
"If VISTAS provides core support for the Morning Star team by meeting salary, office and vehicle needs, then the implementation of the Morning Star pilot and ongoing Morning Star activities will be supported, because: A team is required to implement Morning Star activities being funded under other VISTAS activities"
"IF Morning Star creates and refines a new, fiveday trauma awareness tool to complement existing MS programming, THEN Morning Star will be equipped with an effective new tool to reach a larger number of people with trauma awareness, BECAUSE a trained cadre of people, consisting of MS staff (Junior Field Coordinator) and recruited from the existing Resource Facilitators, will be able to replicate this training in a short period of time in multiple communities across South Sudan."
"IF VISTAS reviews the Morning Star Curriculums to ensure that the medical and trauma aspects meet  internationally accepted standards THEN the quality and accuracy of the curriculums will be improved and more effective BECAUSE materials that are based on strong academic terms of medical information and understanding of trauma, and are consistent with current international standards of trauma awareness programming are higher quality materials and will improve the Morning Star curriculum."
"By providing a forum for community leaders to discuss common issues and priorities in a transparent and structured setting, CCI will be able to better focus future programming to address issues that cause fractures between communities and their government."
"By enhancing situational awareness of Muqur district, this activity will set the conditions for ASI's future stabilization activities."
"By supporting weekly atmospherics reports, this activity will enable ASI to develop a targeted district stabilization strategy, populate a Muqur district stability framework, and implement appropriate stability programming."
"By providing an opportunity for tribal elders of Muqur to meet in a secure location and contribute to a stabilization plan, the grant will strengthen cooperation among local communities and GIRoA and mitigate the influence of AGEs."
"This open house will allow local government officials and prominent elders to establish lines of communication, creating a platform from which to discuss stabilization and governance initiatives."

Improving the physical accessibility and the security of the district center will increase the accessibility of the district center and the district government.
"The Marawara district government  center does not have the physical capacity, such as basic furniture, to do the work of governing.  If the District Governor is provided with basic furniture and other office materials, then the DG's capacity and the perception of the district government in the eyes of the people will be improved."
"District government has tenuous control of Marawara District.  If activities that expand the reach of the district government and help them to identify and alleviate sources of instability are implemented, then there will be an improvement in the capacity of the government to reduce conflict."
By training formal and traditional district leaders in six key civics messages the formal and traditional district leaders will be more motivated to work together to resolve sources of instability in Marawara District.

"IF VISTAS supports a post migration conference between Misseriya pastoralists and host Dinka Malual THEN it will ensure a peaceful return of Misseriya pastoralists and their cattle back to West Kordofan and lay the groundwork for a successful migration for next year BECAUSE  High level chiefs from the communities will address any pending disputes including but not limited to the payment of blood arrears, cattle thefts, refunding those whose properties were destroyed, as well as coming up with mechanisms of addressing issues which arise after the premigration conference  Community representatives will have a chance to discuss what elements of the migration worked, areas of improvement, unforeseen issues and lesson learned for future migrations  Build further trust between both the communites and enable a more condusive environment for the traders to keep coming in to South Sudan with essential supplies"
"Theory of Change: IF VISTAS supports peace dialogue between Awlad Kamil (Misseriya) pastoralists and the Dinka Rek of Warrap State THEN discussions facilitated by Dinka Malual and Misseriya Fayereen representatives take place between these border communties on outstanding issues and potential future conflicts. BECAUSE It will provide the space for dialogue between the Dinka Rek and Awlad Kamil communities which wasnt there before.  The Dinka Malual and Misseriya Fayareen will facilitate the dialogue enabling the Awlad Kamil and Dinka Rek to see what mechanisms have enabled a peaceful soft border between their communities.  The dialogue will provide an opportunity to address outstanding issues between the communities that have proven to be a hindrance to peace such as but not limited to cases of blood compensation, cattle thefts, land disputes, rape and killings."
"If the VISTAS program supports the fencing of Internews Aweil FM compound in Aweil town and also helps carryout study on solar power system feasibility as an alternate power source, THEN the station built would be secure and be a source of reliable news and information to audience seeking objective and nonpartisan news, BECAUSE: A new station will be built within the fenced area in Aweil which will enable it to be in a central location in NBeG and reach to border areas which are not currently within its broadcast radius.  The station would have an alternate source of power to lengthen its daily hours of broadcasting from 8 to 16.  The station would have a secure compound which will enable a more condusive environment for daily operation  leading to increase of its outreach to people who don't benefit from any other sources of news."
"IF VISTAS supports a PreMigration conference between Rezeigat pastoralists and the host Dinka Malual community, THEN the leadership of the two communities will meet to discuss and agree on conditions and rules that would lead to a successful migrationBECAUSE The rules and conditions set will hold the communities accountable; and  The two communities do not have the resources to hold a conference where hundreds of community member can gather together from different parts of East Darfur and Northern Bahr el Ghazal"

"Información documentada y veraz sobre las dinámicas de conflicto, economías ilegales y estructuras locales de poder (legales e ilegales) contribuirá a mejorar la capacidad de Transforma para identificar posibles tensiones y conflictos, y en este sentido proponer y desarrollar actividades tendientes a mitigar los riesgos que amenazan la implementación inicial de los acuerdos de paz.  "
"If dialogue and communication spaces are promoted between the various actors in the department, it will be much easier to identify the thematic lines and structural axes that the region requires to properly implement the peace agreements. To facilitate the transport and accommodation of key players through a specific logistical support, will help build trust between the government entities and people involved in the implementation of the agreements, as well as in the process of identifying activities and projects oriented to rapid response and peace accords preparedness. "
"By increasing participation of individuals from geographic areas who had not previously participated in regional events, and of additional community members in awareness raising events regarding the peace accords, the accords will have a greater likelihood of being accepted in those regions.  The identifaction of new leaders in different sectors, including in artistic, social and cultural areas, will expand and diversify the participation of civil society involved in implementing the accords.  Increasing spaces for dialogue among different regional actors will help decrease the proliferation of conflict and tensions that could threaten the initial phases of implementation. "
"If we develop a training program focused on values and social skills, complementary to the practice of Rugby aimed at children, youth and adolescents in the metropolitan area of Cucuta,THENWe will strengthen a rugby school and Fundación Calidad con Calidez, as agents of change in leadership and peaceful coexistence of children, youth and adolescents and their families, BECAUSEwe will be promoting the involvement of civil society organizations in the implementation of peace agreements with a collaborative and inclusive focus. "
If we provide technical and logistical support to the consolidation of an alliance of universities and higher education institutions (HEI) in Norte de Santander participating in building regional peace and implementation of the Peace Accords.THENWe will be contributing with the involvement of regional academy through rapid response activities in the implementation of the peace accords.BECAUSEWe will be promoting the involvement of key civil society organizations in the implementation of peace agreements with a collaborative and inclusive focus. 
"IFIf we provide ASOPERSONEROS in Catatumbo with financial and logitcal support to create a central regional office and a strategic plan that will increse their operational and technical capacity;THEN We will strengthen the capacity of ASOPERSONEROS to identify and execute rapid response and peace agreement implementation activities in the Catatumbo;BECAUSE Currently, ASOPERSONEROS lacks the central meeting and coordination space, leadership and technical capacity to respond to the needs of its members and communities in Catatumbo;  Having a central regional office, leadership and technical support will give ASOPERSONEROS greater visibility, credibility and capacity to take action regarding rapid response and peace agreement implementation;  ASOPERSONEROS is recognized as a key actor for rapid response and accord implemenation that is poised to expand its role. "
"If we support Fundacion Progresar´s efforts to conduct an action research study on the realignment of power and sociopolitical dynamics in eleven municipalities of Catatumbo and its relevance in the context of peace negotiations with the FARC.THEN  We will be able to increase the capacity of local authorities and civil society organizations organizations in the subregion of Catatumbo to identify and implement rapid response activities focused on the peace agreement.BECAUSEThey will have more information and knowledge about new changes in the realignement of power and the sociopolitical context in the Catatumbo subregion, considering that currently there is no clear, up to date understanding of how these actors and dynamics will interact and potentially derail peace agreement implementation. "
"IFCommunity radio station staff receive training and guidance in the design, development and dissemination of radio content on peace building and coexistence;THENThey will be a more effective channel of information on progress and issues related to the peace accords in rural and periurban zones; BECAUSE The community radio station staff are not yet trained or capable of producing and providing information related to the peace accords, and there are very few effective channels to objectively inform on the progress and topics of the peace accords in rural and periurban zones."
"If we logistically support  the prior consultation process with traditional indigenous authorities of the Motilón Bari community and national authorities in order to develop the National Park Environmental Management Plan. THENWe will contribute to increased involvement of National Parks and the Ministry of Interior as coordinating entities in collaborative planning and conservation processes in the framework of the peace accords. BECAUSEThe governmental agencies present in the area (National Parks and Ministry of Interior) will work on a concrete experience of prior consultation in the territory with a differentiated approach and because we will be facilitating a space for interaction between the indigenous community and government agencies, taking advantage of the opportunity for dialogue offered by the peace accords."
"If we conduct training workshops using cultural and artistic expression (literature, dance, theater and painting) with peace and coexistence messages in alliance with La Playa de Belen municipal authorities focused on boys and girls at risk from the Aspasica Youth Home, and their families;THENWe will promote positive change in the relationships and perceptions between atrisk community members (children and families) and municipal authorities in the La Playa de Belen, Catatumbo  in preparation for peace agreement implementation;BECAUSEWork with atrisk children from the Youth Home of Aspasica is an effective and nonpolemical entry point and common cause that can unite and help create positive change and perceptions between the La Playa de Belen community members and municipal authorities.Security conditions and stability in the target community remain stable enough to plan and execute the activity. "
"If we provide support and technical training to fourteen (14) local governments in the subregion of Catatumbo and the Province of Ocaña, for the elaboration of rapid response and peace accord preparation and implementation public investment projects using a Mobile Technical Support Team THENWe will be strengthening the capacity and preparedness of local authorities to identify, develop, and manage rapid response and peace accord preparation and implementation public investment projectsBECAUSELocal authorities of Catatumbo and the province of Ocaña have critically low levels of capacity for public investment projects, particularly focused on rapid response and the Havana agreement; and, they have expressed high levels of interest and commitment to increasing their capacities"
"If we support the execution of a highlevel event in Bogota to start construction of a postconflict roadmap between local authorities of Catatumbo and national government representatives;THENWe will provide a catalytic opportunity for municipal authorities, departmental and other key players to work with national government representatives for the construction of a postconflict roadmap for the Catatumbo;BECAUSECatatumbo local authorities face a critical lack of access to information on national government strategies and plans for peace agreement implementation in their territories, which inhibits their ability to prepare; and,  national government authorities face scheduling and logistical challenges that hinder their ability to engage directly in the territories with local authorities to build legitimacy and prepare for agreement implementation and construction of a postconflict roadmap for Catatumbo. "
"If we support the execution of 12 ""Citizen Dialogues for Peace"" in six municipalities of the Metropolitan Area of Cucuta and strengthen the Metropolitan Network of Women Peace Advocates;THENWe will promote open and inclusive dialogue between diverse civil society stakeholders, especially women leaders, regarding peacebuilding and implementation of the peace agreement in critical conflictaffected municipalities of Cucuta.  BECAUSE1. Women´s organizations are interested in having more information and clarity about how they can be proactive leaders for the implementation of the peace agreement; 2. Citizen Dialogues have proven to be an open, inclusive and costeffective means for sharing diverse views respectfully regarding the peace agreement with large numbers of stakeholders (over 3,000), as well as for women leaders to have a voice. "
"SI Apoyamos la consolidación del Espacio de Vida de la Pastoral Social de Ocaña a través de la dotación y funcionamiento en una primera etapa de este centro ubicado en el Barrio San Fermín que tiene una alta presencia de victimas armadas del conflicto armado provenientes de la región del Catatumbo, ENTONCES Estaríamos ayudando a incrementar el involucramiento de la Alcaldía municipal de Ocaña y de la Diócesis de Ocaña a través del servicio de Pastoral Social, en el desarrollo de actividades sociales y de atención a comunidades vulnerables, PORQUELa Diócesis y Pastoral Social de la región de Ocaña no han estado del todo involucradas en los procesos de construcción de paz y reconstrucción del tejido social en el Catatumbo; y actualmente se encuentran interesados en ocupar esos espacios de interacción con las comunidades vulnerables que dejaron abandonadas durante los últimos años. "
"SI Apoyamos logísticamente (hospedaje, alimentación y espacio de reunión) la realización del Encuentro “Concejos Municipales Constructores de Paz en el Catatumbo” organizado por la Red Sueños Catatumbo.ENTONCES Estaríamos propiciando la generación de un espacio de información por parte del Gobierno Nacional dirigido a miembros de los Concejos Municipales de Tibú, El Tarra, Sardinata y Bucarasica sobre los Acuerdos de Paz y el estado del proceso de paz, así como estaríamos facilitando la posibilidad de que los concejos reciban orientaciones para asumir los planes de desarrollo como una oportunidad para avanzar en la construcción de paz territorial.PORQUELos concejos municipales del Catatumbo no han sido vinculados directamente a los procesos de información y divulgación de los acuerdos de paz, y son los concejales quienes discuten y aprueban los planes municipales de desarrollo en los cuales se incluirán iniciativas de implementación y construcción de paz en cada territorio."
"IF We organize ""Peace to Youth"" strategy participatory workshops (12) involving at least 200 youth in the municipality of Ocaña on issues related to territorial peacebuilding and unlearning violence.THENWe will implement and evaluate the ""Peace to Youth"" strategy workshops led by the ""Young Colombia"" Presidency program in the critical Catatumbo context to prepare youth and enhance government presence on the eve of the signing of the Havana peace agreement. BECAUSEIt is important to quickly push forward and support activities that make visible and engage national entities (other than the MPC, OHCP) in the marginalized Catatumbo that work with youth as change agents for peacebuilding and also prepare for eventual implementation of the Havana agreement; and in Ocaña, Catatumbo, there is a critical lack of cohesion and join efforts between civil society (especially youth) and government to strengthen social capital, trust and direct collaboration to build territorial peace. "
"If we help produce approximately fifteen (15) audiovisual products with joint participation of communities and municipal government stakeholders focused on the Catatumbo and the Havana peace agreement.ThenBuild trust between Catatumbo communities and municipal government stakeholders through joint development and dissemination of strategic communications products promoting the role of the region in peacebuilding and Havana Peace agreement implementation. BecauseCurrently there are high levels of mistrust between Catatumbo communities and municipal government stakeholders that prevent them from working together and prepare for Havana peace agreement implementation; Currently the Catatumbo region is highly stigmatized by a long history of armed conflict and presence of illegal armed groups, which affected local perceptions regarding capacities for peacebuilding and roles in implementing the Havana peace agreement. Joint work between communities and municipal government stakeholders for development and dissemination of audiovisual materials is an effective means for building trust and change local perceptions. "
"If we provide logistical support (sound and sports equipment, agricultural tools, transportation) for the realization of the Otare Farmers Day Festival in the village of Otare within the Province of Ocaña.  THENWe will facilitate the creation of spaces that allow a greater relationship between the community, social organizations and local authorities around peace construction and reconciliation activities BECAUSERecent security events related to the armed conflict have undermined confidence and coordination between territorial actors in Otare, and there is a shortage of spaces for cultural, social and recreational experiences about peace building that encourage interaction of local actors."
"IFProvide needed logistical support for a Youth Peace Leaders event as well as equipment and musical instruments to equip their music hall in the town of Campo Dos in the municipality of Tibu;THENWe will support the strengthening of Youth Peace Leaders and give them positive alternatives to involvement in illicit activities and armed conflict within the town of Campo Dos in Tibu; BECAUSECurrently the Youth Peace Leaders members are in need, interested and will continue to be committed to participating in leadership and music activities as a positive alternative; Leadership and music activities are positive catalysts for change when working with youth at risk and in zones of illicit activities and armed conflict. Security conditions will permit the full execution of the activity. "
"If we support logistically the realization of a Trail Bike for Peace in Tibu: “Pedaling for Peace” through the delivery of basic sports elements with messages related to territorial peace construction.THENWe will be promoting spaces that allow a greater relationship between local community, social organizations and local authorities around peace building and reconciliation activities.BECAUSEIn Tibu there are very few social and recreational spaces that promote the culture of legality and peace, and in which local authorities, social organizations and the community in general work together around peaceful coexistence."
"If we provide logistical support to launch a new round of visits to the Catatumbo region of the Departmental Mobile Unit for Victims and Territorial Peace Building in Norte de Santander.THENWe can spearhead a rapid response intervention with state entities for mobile conflict victim´s assistance and peacebuilding into difficult access Catatumbo communities expanding government presence, legitimacy and trustbuilding. BECAUSEThere is a lack of mobile and flexible access to difficult to reach Catatumbo communities to provide integrated rapid response government service delivery to conflictaffected communities; There is a critical lack of government presence, legitimacy and trust between remote Catabumbo conflictaffected communities and government entities;Government entities are having difficulties effectively coordinating rapid response activities for conflict victim´s assistance and peacebuilding in preparation for the implementation of the Havana agreement. "
"IF We train and equip community Civil Defense, Fire Brigades and municipal functionaries in 15 municipalities of Catatumbo to increase their response capacity to community emergencies during the initial period of Havana peace agreement implementation. THENWe will help increase communitylevel capacities to prevent and respond to emergencies, improve government credibility and improve coordination between municipal, government and national stakeholders to meet postconflict challenges in Catatumbo.BECAUSEProviding local authorities and emergency prevention and response agencies with training and equipment is an effective means to improve government credibility with citizens and coordination between key stakeholders. Local authorities and agencies are not equipped to handle emerging situations during the peace agreement implementation phase; and there exist no coordination mechanisms between these entities within the Catatumbo, currently.The security situation in the Catatumbo will remain reasonably stable in order to execute the activity. "
"If we help to rapidly develop community capacity, trust and partnership between small producers and government through irrigation support with ASOPREMA and 60 small onion producers; Then   Civil society, communitybased organizations (and government) will help mobilize key conflict affected communities around territorial peace and the final peace agreement. BecauseRapid response material support focused on quickly responding to specific, tangible community and small producer needs is an effective means to build community capacity, begin to develop trust and build partnership with government.Even though it is a critical need, the ASOPREMA members in El Carmen municipality lack the resources and training to establish the irrigation system.Communal activities with existing organized producer associations, such as smallscale irrigation, have been proven to strengthen community participation. The peace agreement, point one on integrated rural reform, outlines the importance of irrigation systems for creating stable livelihoods and materializing concrete peace dividends in rural communities directly affected by conflict as well as illicit crop cultivation. "
"IF Support 140 atrisk youth develop and broadcast music and cultural projects (music and video recording, graffiti) in their communities;THENWe will help expand the role of youth change agents and the ""Del Norte Hijos Bravos"" musical and cultural project for teaching and sharing about the Havana peace agreement and peacebuilding; BECAUSEThere is a critical need in Norte de Santander for mobilizing youth and other citizens to increase buyin and identification with the Havana peace agreement and the importance of peacebuilding / questioning violence; Youth change agents from the ""Del Norte Hijos Bravos"" group have demonstrated their ability to use musical and artistic expression as an effective means of communication and messaging regarding peacebuilding; Other citizens in the target communities will view youth members and their projects in a positive light (music, video, graffiti) and support them / be interested in their messaging; "
"If we support the development of at least 28 radio broadcasts regarding government and civil society activities that promote peacebuilding and coexistence based on their diverse, urban and rural experiences;THENWe will help to broadcast information on municipal, department and national government and community initiatives as an intersector strategy to strengthen bonds and consolidate a common vision among stakeholders regarding the benefits of the Havana peace agreement.BECAUSECurrently in Catatumbo there are not enough platforms for coordination and interaction between government institutions and communities. Community confidence in government initiatives and programs is low requiring rapid and effective measures to build confidence. Community radio is one of the most effective communications tool for sharing information widely and promoting joint efforts between government and communities focused on the Havana agreement and peacebuilding.  "
"If the Colombian government and Catatumbo communities create spaces to jointly identify viable rapid response productive projects and value chains in support of Havana agreement implementation;THENAssuming these projects come to fruition, the government will build trust with communities by demonstrating tangible benefits of peace and provide opportunities to catalyze future development in Catatumbo territories for Havana peace agreement implementation. BECAUSERapid response productive projects can be strategic and effective during the immediate postsignature and initial peacea agreement implementation period for building trust between government and communities, increasing legitimacy of the peace agreement and demonstrating tangible benefits of peace; In the Catatumbo, due to the long history of violence, armed conflict and mistrust, few spaces exist for sharing knowledge and experiences regarding productive projects and value chains focused on rapid response and peace agreement implementation "
"IFProvide key logistical support (chairs, food, sound and stage equipment) needed to organize the “Department Art Contest: Forgiveness, Reconciliation and Peace"" in the city of Cucuta by the Colombian Agency for Reintegration (ACR) among others, with the participation of atrisk children and youth from Norte de Santander and Arauca.THENHelp expand the effectiveness and legitimacy of the Colombian Agency for Reintegration (ACR) and other institutions, to unite public, private and civil society actors utilizing social and cultural initiatives that build forgiveness, reconciliation and territorial peace. BECAUSEi) The ACR in Norte de Santander continues to be a key government agency and catalyst for launching large scale forgiveness, reconciliation and territorial peace initiatives with at risk children and youth; ii) The ACR is a government agency that is capable of helping to increase citizen perceptions regarding government effectiveness and legitimacy regarding territorial peace and Havana agreement preparations; iii) In Norte de Santander there is a critical lack of social and cultural events and initiatives that have the ability to reach a high number of institutions and such a wide audience / number of at risk children and youth."
"If we increase civil society leader effectiveness, collaboration and participation through the development and use of tool kits; Then We will help them to more effectively mobilize their community members for peacebuilding and coexistence activities using nonviolent strategies that contribute to peace agreement preparation and eventual implementation. Because civil society leaders and their community members have high levels of mistrust and low levels of collaboration and participation due to conflict impacts.civil society leaders and their community members lack effective methods and tools that they can use for peacebuilding and coexistence activities. if mistrust, tensions and lack of practical mechanisms persist, these civil society leaders and their community members will be unable to engage and participate effectively in peace preparation and implementation. "
"If we help government institutions, as part of Havana peace agreement rapid response, to build trust with conflict victims and civil society stakeholders for the search and identification of ""disappeared"" people; THENWe help Norte de Santander government and civil society organizations contribute to the visibility of the benefits of accords Peace in the territory (Cluster Result 2). BECAUSE Search, identification and clarifying circumstances of death of disappeared persons and returning of remains to relatives is a critical first step for peace agreement implementation, building trust and building peace.   Lack of government action and progress in this process threatens to create tensions, mistrust and disappointment of conflict victims and civil society in the peace agreement and early rapid response.  Security conditions will permit the full implementation of the activity, considering perpetrators (e.g. exparamilitaries) may be opposed to the process and begin threatening the team or relatives. Transforma, together with grantee Fundacion Procesar, government forensics and relatives will take security precautions and monitor the situation continually. "
"If we execute a tertiary road inventory in Convencion municipality to increase visibility of rapid response, local capacity and community participation in initial peace agreement implementation; ThenGovernment will exercise its leadership and presence at the local level and better deliver on its responsibilities within the framework of the peace agreement.Because Doing a tertiary road inventory that is costeffective and includes community participation is a strategic first step for moving forward with tangible rapid response at the local level. Using new mapping technologies and decentralized processes is a potential means for reducing costs and speeding up time required for tertiary road inventories that may be learned from and replicated by Transforma and government entities. Community expectations and perceptions are managed appropriately in order to ensure the activity doesn´t unduly raise community expectations, and that the activity doesn´t necessarily indicate a large scale rollout of widereaching tertiary road projects in the short term. "
"If we help the indigenous Bari better lead and mobilize livelihoods activities in their communities based on trusting working relationships with the National Park Service; Then They will be able to lead their communities effectively hand in hand with the National Parks Service to tangibly improve their communties´ livelihoods while also managing natural resources effectively for peace implementation;  Because  The Bari indigenous communities are willing to implement measures for their protected areas through the establishment of cacao livelihoods with their members.  National Parks Service wants to continue working on conservation issues, mainly through the promotion of new livelihoods for the indigenous communities, like the Bari, that live in national parks.  The indigenous Bari are a strategic partner and actor in the territory who are eager and committed to taking on new responsibilities to further peace preparation and implementation.  Indigenous communities settled inside National parks are seeking livelihoods and incomes that do not come into conflict with protected area and conservation strategies. Despite having been affected by presence of illegal armed actors and illicit crops in their communities, indigenous Bari leaders and youth want to distance themselves from illegal activities and build security and peace. "
"If we help increase Bari and indigenous association leader capacity and autonomy to respond to community needs and act as change agents for dialogue and peace agreement implemenation; Then They will be more capable of mobilizing timely and effective responses to their indigenous community needs and for mobilizing member participation in open dialogue and actions that support peace agreement implementation. Because The Bari and their association members are critically vulnerable to incursions by illegal armed groups, trafficking and illicit crops during the peace agreement implementation phase as they lack the operational / administrative capacity and training to effectively respond to community needs and lead discussions and actions for peace agreement implementation in their territories. The Bari need to protect their rights, autonomy, organization and way of life during the postconflict period, without which they run the risk of creating new divisions in their communities and missing out on key opportunities for autonmy, selfgovernance and leadership for the future of their territory and people. The security dynamics in the Bari communities permit activity implementation. "
"If We enable department government and citizens to work together and implementing the Norte de Santander ""Department PostConflict Plan"" focusing on participation, colaboration and ""twoway pacts""; Then Department government of Norte de Santander will visibily exercise its leadership and better mobilize its citizens around common needs outlined in the ""Department PostConflict Plan"" in a spirit of coresponsibilities. BecauseThe department government has demonstrated strong commitment and concreate actions to prepare for Peace Agreement implementation and postconflict planning framed in the specific needs of its citizens. The department government has requested rapid response support to respond to the window of opportunity to engage citizens and kick start its departmental PostConflict Plan, that will dovetail with the national level rapid response. The weak presence of government institutions continues to give a lot of space for illegal armed groups to take action and coopt communites. "
"If the municipal Culture Secretariat in Teorama launches implementation of the cultural section of the Municipal Develop Plan by leading extracurricular art and sports programs in the most disadvantaged and conflict affected districts,THENIt will provide an effective response the community's demands expressed in the participative formulation process and carry out the Municipal Development PlanBECAUSEYouth and their families in the districts of San Pablo, La Cecilia, El Aserrio y San Juancito of Teorama Municipality will be more likely to trust the municipal government, view it as capable and responsive to their expressed needs, and remain in the educational system.The municipal administration through the Cultural Secretariat wants to fulfill the commitments undertaken during the participative formulation of the Municipal Development Plan, but lacks the resources to do so.The districts of San Pablo, La Cecilia, El Aserrio and San Juancito of Teorama Municipality were prioritized by the Municipal Culture Secretariat because they are the most distant and lack of institutional presence.  "
"If the OACP shares contextualized information about the agreement No. 1 to the Farmers Union Association THEN The agriculture and farming guilds will know firsthand the implications of this agreement in the different productive sectors in the department BECAUSE In the discussions held within the unions there has been a lot of speculations about what will happen to the productive sectors in Norte de Santander with the demobilization of the FARC troops, especially in things such as land, property formalization, agricultural frontiers, among others.  There has not been enough dialogue spaces with the OACP to clarify the implications the agricultural point of the accords will have in the territory.  The unions have expressed their intention to be better informed and with this give their support to the implementation of the accords."
"3. State entities with local presence exercise their leadership role and deliver on their responsibilities within the framework of the peace accords (Cluster Result 1). If we enable the Hacari municipal government to lead a response to rural youth home infrastructure and equipment needs; Then We will help it take on a visible leadership role, gain credibility and deliver on its responsibilities within the framework of peace agreement preparation and implementation at the territorial level.BecauseThe municipal administration has the will to close the gaps between government institutions and their services to rural communities, but they don't have enough resources and operational capacity to respond with infrastructure and protection. The Pastoral Social is a respected and strategic actor that will facilitate entry into this remote community affected by conflict. Improving the youth home in Hacari provides a new opportunity to work for the first time with this municipal government and build trust for future activities. Rapid response small infrastructure improvement activities led by trusted community actors (Pastoral) and local government is an effective partnership strategy for building community trust and credibility By improving the physical conditions of the youth home in Hacari, it will become easier to respond to the demands of new quotas to get into the educational system and it will help increase youth protection. "
"IfFundacion con Vida prepares, reviews and monitors, Colombia Transforma's Environmental Monitoring and Mitigation Plans (EMMP) for small infrastructure and income generation activities and ensures Transforma's compliance with Colombian law and USAID regulations related to environmental monitoring and mitigation; ThenColombia Tranforma will successfully mitigate the negative impact of such activities on the environment while implementing small infrastructure and income generation activities in key communities designed to take advantage of windows of opporunity in key communities for the Havana accords. ; BecauseTransforma activities must ensure that environmental monitoring and mitigation plans are used when required in order to reduce / minimize environmental impacts per Colombian law and USAID regulations; Transforma has a number of important small infrastructure and income generation activities that require EMMPs, which must progress quicly; Fundacion con Vida has technical expertise in environmental monitoring and mitigation, understands Colombian law and USAID regulations, and has developed EMMPs that can be implemented using USAID OTI's busines model for activities that must be designed and implemented quickly."
"Si se apoya la organizacion de encuentros de dialogos y formacion en municipios estragegicos liderado por la OACP; EntoncesSe promoverán espacios de diálogo constructivo entre la OACP y comunidades con el fin de dar claridades y responder a sus preocupaciones sobre los pasos, tiempos y roles de implementación de los acuerdos y se aumentará la capacidad de gestionar acciones para la construcción de paz en zonas priorizadas de alta y muy alta afectación por el conflicto.Porque La OACP ha identificado la necesidad critica de expandir su presencia en comunidades prioritarias cerca de las ZVTN y de alta y muy alta afectación para abrir la comunicación y participación de diversos actores de las comunidades para transformar sus preocupaciones y tensiones que pueden volver desestabilizadores que afectan la implementacion. La OACP ha quiere aprovecha una ventana de oportunidad de lograr que las diferentes audiencias en estos territorios se conviertan en dinamizadores de los acuerdos de paz y que puedan liderar acciones de construcción de paz locales.  Contribuye para que diferentes audiencias (campesinos, profesores, diócesis, JAC, organizaciones sociales de mujeres, víctimas y jóvenes) participen en diálogos con la OACP y para poder asumir papeles de liderazgo."
"If the Teorama municipal government works handinhand with its community members to recover public spaces associated with armed conflict; 2. Build trust and visible collaboration between the Teorama municipal government and citizen groups through joint rehabilitation of public spaces previously assoicated with armed conflict. Then Trust, collaboration and perceptions of taking back control of public spaces from conflict and positive change towards peace will increase. BecauseCurrently, public spaces in Teorama are associated with traumatic events during the armed conflict that generated fear and apathy  among community members, and a reluctance to invest time and resources in them, causing them to fall into disrepair. During the conflict, several of the public spaces were taken over and controlled by armed actors to intimidate, attack and exercise control. The Teorama municipal government and community leaders are committed and have already developed the ""Teorama Spring"" project as part of their wider municipal development plan focused on recovering from conflict and making Teorama an attractive regional tourism destination. Joint activities between local government and community stakeholders that transform/improve public spaces is a proven means to increase trust, collaboration and help change public perceptions and fears. Security conditions continue to be stable and new criminal bands and armed actors do not intimidate or vandalize. "
"IfLocal actors from the ""Kilometer 60"" community and government lead joint rehabilitation projects of public spaces previously associated with assassinations and massacres during the conflict; Then Community stakeholders will be able to resignify public spaces, overcome trauma and fear and the government will be able to follow through on its role supporting conflict victims as outlined in the peace agreement with the FARC. BecuaseThe restoration of the symbolic spaces will help facilitate trustbuilding between the community and government institutions and initial peace agreement implementation at the local level. The rehabilitated spaces will help to bring community members together to recover and openly practice their cultural and social practices they were forced to abandon during the armed conflict and control by armed groups. Joint rehabilitation activities are an effective means of resignfying public spaces where horrific conflict events have taken place  such as torture, assinations, massacres  that can help victims and community members rebuild their lives for the future. Joint rehabilitation activities coupled with safe spaces for open dialogue and conflict victim expression can help further reconciliation and territorial peacebuilding. "
"If Procure and install an auxiliary water pump to ensure the functioning of the Convencion municipal water system and citizen access to water; ThenWe will help improve Concepción municipal government capacity to meet citizen basic needs, reduce tensions and increase its leadership for peacebuilding.

"If the participation is increased and the mobilization of the communities and departmental social organizations and of different population groups in Cucuta and the metropolitan area in the activities done in the frame work of the Peace Week through Transforma logistical support (invitations, visibility, materials). THEN Activities organized during ""Peace Week"" will have increased participation, visibility and effects promoting coexistence and peacebuilding framed in the Havana agreement. BECAUSEPeace activities in Cucuta lack clarity and visibility among urban populations, leading to apathy and low participation.

BecauseWith start of peace agreement implementation with the FARC, community members are increasingly impatient about wanting to see new Obudsmen leadership, government presence and access to information regarding conflict victim´s assistance. There are high levels of misinformation on the agreement and point five among rural communities of Catatumbo that are affecting their trust and support in agreement implementation. The Obudsmen are unique change agents who are able to straddle the space and relations between remote and underserved communities with presence of armed groups and municipal and department governments. Therefore, they play a key role in agreement implementation. "
"IfACR has timely logistical support to carryout it´s ""Letters of Forgiveness"" psychsocial support and reconciliation activity with excombatants and victims;  Then The ACR will be able to make visible among citizens and stakeholders that government is delivering on its obligations and responsibilities framed in the peace agreement.  BECAUSEThe weak presence of state entities in actions directed towards forgiveness and reconciliation between victims and excombatants have caused agencies like the ACR to have difficulties following through on its mandate. There is an important number of excombatants that are already civilians that are searching for an opportunity to participate in these kind of spaces, cohabitation and reconciliation activities.This activity will allow state entities to fulfill its commitment to help create a safe space where victim´s assistance institutions and excombatant institutions work together. "
"If the municipal administration and the communities work together to reduce the mobility difficulties between the marginal rural populations  THENThe mayor's office's rapid response efforts gain visibility wiithin rural communities, improving the relationship between the two. BECAUSEThe municipal administration of San Calixto is committed and has the capacity to leverage external resources to execute projects that will improve mobility of the families from one part of the municipality to another.With the working materials and the technical assistance for the rehabilitation of suspension bridge in San Jose de Quebradillas, families that live in the southern part of San Calixto will contribute labor to the rehabilitation effort.In this village, there is presence of two illegal armed groups and other social actors that delegitimize local authority's actions in the solution of everyday problems of vulnerable rural communities.

Because The Ocaña municipal and other Catatumbo government leaders have been forward learning in seeking out opportunities like the Peace Games to demonstrate leadership and begin integrating the region and its stakeholders under a new identity oriented towards peace. Peace Games provide a costeffective platform to engage high numbers of youth and other stakeholders around key peacebuilding visibility and messaging. Municipal governments, de sports and recreation department (COLDEPORTES), private sector and civil society groups are committed to overcoming the stigma of conflict and becoming visible leaders for peacebuilding in their territory. "
"If we help increase collaboration between government to raise awareness about the importance of reintegration, forgiveness and reconciliation processes with conflict victims outlined in the Final Peace Agreement. ThenState entities such as the ACR and UARIV will exercise leadership and deliver on their responsibilities regarding the Final Peace Agreement provisions for forgiveness and reconciliation processes with conflict victims. BecauseCatatumbo has a long history of insurgent groups and paramilitaries that have generated a large number of victims that can benefit greatly from forgiveness and reconciliation processes as a precondition for longer term peacebuilding. Public, symbolic activities and events for forgiveness and reconciliation between victims and perpetrators who admit responsibility, including demobilized excombatants is an effective means for raising awareness of the issue with the general public, and for advancing the healing process. The ACR and UARIV are two key government entities for the forgiveness and reconciliation process that must coordinate at the national and territorial levels. "
"If the 15 ASOJUNTAS have the proper training, organizational strengthening and equipment support; Then The 15 ASOJUNTAS will have the technical and operational capacity to develop and lead territorial peace projects and activities with their 284 member Community Action Board members in critical peace geographies; Because Asojuntas have the will to organize themselves and use their local capacities to manage resources and increase community´s participation in related actions.Pastoral Social of Tibu has expressed its interest being a leader of local initiatives by preparing the community and its organizations so that they increase their participation in actions related to peace construction in the territory.The strengthening workshops with Asojuntas will facilitate the training and identification of new agents of peace construction."

The Office of the High Commissioner of Peace (OHCP) has special initiatives focused on ethnic groups and peace that are relevant to the Bari despite the ""No"" plebiscite vote.  The Bari community members and their leaders are very concerned about the implications of peace in their territories in terms of new colonization and invasions on their acestral lands, as well as risks to youth.

"IFMunicipal/national authorities and JAC of La Angalia execute in an articulate manner a concrete rapid response activityTHENcommunities will make visible the State response to their needs without the intervention of peasants social movements or illicit armed actors.BECAUSE The base organizations have taken the initiative to manage resources before State Institutions and International Cooperation for their communities in an independent and direct manner.There is an uncertainty in the communities generated because of the noncompliance of the historical commitments made by the government when they have visited their territories.The leaders in La Angalia have kept aloof of actions being led by peasants associations, which is why these organizations have initiated a campaign to discredit leaders of this sector."
"If we help improve the ability of the Abrego municipal goverment to execute rural road rapid response projects; ThenThey will be able to work closely with, and demonstrate tangible benefits of peace in, communities prioritized for territorial peace. BecauseAgrego municipal government, in its assessments and experience, has demonstrated that investment in rural roads in the Palmira community zone will help address institutional access and community trust problems, as well as demonstrate tengible peace benefits.

BecauseThe ""Pacelli Nuestra"" association has developed an effective participatory integrated sustainable development model that can be replicated and put into service in support of peace agreement implementation in Tibu municipality and the Catatumbo. The association and its members are respected change agents and ""pioneers"" who have managed to garner political support, credibility and respect in the region due their results between government, communities and cooperation stakeholders. The ""Pacelli Nuestra"" association has great potential for increasing its influential role by helping to connect government entities and key peace geography communities focused on peace agreement integrated rural reform. Strengthening operational and organizational capabilities of existing change agents, such as ""Pacelli Nuestra"" association is an effective means of activiting ""local capacities for peace"" for peace agreement implementation. "
"If We help the Sardinata municipal government repair and remodel a hammock bridge joining strategic conflictaffected communities. ThenWe will help it to take on a much more visible role leading tangible peace rapid response activities that address pressing rural community needs while facilitating connection and trustbuilding. BecauseRapid response small infrastructure projects, if done right, have been proven to be an effective means for local governments, like Sardinata, to engage skeptical communities and demonstrate their leadership and response capacity during transition to peace / peace agreement implementation. Small hammock and foot bridges located in strategic points are key pieces of community infrastructure on which most citizens depend for their daily activities to gain access to their farms as well as access to markets and government services. Despite deep frustrations and distrust, the community leaders and members have expressed interest and commitment to work together with the Sardinata municipal government and the Rural Development Secretariat on the project, which they have identified during their participatory planning process. "
"If we strengthen the organizational capacity of the Pastoral Commission for Victims for integrated victims assistance at the communitylevel; Then We will help increase the effectiveness of conflict victim´s assistance, coordination with institutions and promote community participation peace agreement implementation related to victim´s assistance (Point 5 Havana of the agreement).Because The Pastoral Commission for Victims in Tibu is currently complementing government institution victim´s assistance but it lacks the organizational capacity to be effective and expand it´s role. The Commission is viewed by government and community stakeholders as a credible organization that is playing a leading role with rural conflictaffected communities and conflict victims related to the peace process. The Commission is a lynchpin for coordinating and bridging relations between government institutions and communities, which helps victim´s assistance institutions (e.g. UARIV) gain community access in difficult zones. Improving victims assistance effectiveness with the Commission will provide new motivation for civil society organizations to promote victim´s participation in peace implementation. "
"IF The IGAC works with local actors to generate georeferencing, the Geographic Information System and the LandUse Planning of the 11 municipalities of Catatumbo.THENLocal actors will have technical inputs to move forward with the LandUse Planning and other products need for the productive regulation of the MunicipalitiesBECAUSEThe municipality's administrations and Asomunicipios will contribute with their operative capacities and resources to develop the initiative “Catatumbo: opportunity and territorial development region”.The IGAC has the technical experience to generate the georeference information, as well as the Geographic Information System and the LandUse Planning that is why they disposed of the operative resources offered by Asomunicipios and local administrations to show institutional results.  There is an interest in the participation of regional university so that they can join in the efforts and complement the institutional actions.The IGAC as well as the local institutions of Catatumbo have been searching to stretch the relationship so that they can complement each other and facilitate the georeferencing in the region.The information about the productive regulation at a local level it's out of date which makes it difficult for Municipal administrations in Catatumbo move forward with the LandUse Planning elaboration.The development of the activity will give inputs to the social and productive laws of rural lands, with which state entities will exercise their responsibilities with an integral interventions that will develop in an overall Rural Reform "

BecauseTibu has been prioritized by government and the UARIV for collective reparations of conflict victims, which includes the prioritization of youth participation and community peacebuilding activities. Youth in Tibu have already established an informal network of youth civil society organizations and they are leading peacebuilding activities. Youth are a demographic hard hit by armed conflict in Tibu who must be engaged and provided opportunities for constructive participation and leadership in order to harness their energy and commitment as well as to reduce risks of involvement in violence during the transition. The security conditions remain stable and peace leaders, including youth, have sufficient protections. "
"If we provide support for the Pacelli community footbridge rehabilitation with collaboration between JACs, community members and Tibu municipal government instratstructure secretariat;  ThenWe will help to quickly increase collaborative work for rapid response small infrastructure projects in the region that can contribute to territorial peace implementation. BecauseThe Pacelli JACs and community members are open and committed to taking concrete action together in partnership with government to improve their access and quality of life through small infrastructure and the foot bridge.

The rehabilitation of the footbridge will have immediate impacts on citizen lives helping them to get agricultural production to market, access government services, schooling  thereby helping government to counteract negative perceptions about its lack of presence and response to community needs. "
"If the Capitán Largo Community Hall is equipped and operational and the JAC members are trained; ThenWe will help expand conflict victims services, collaboration and coresponsibilities between the Abrego municipal government and the JAC leaders of Capitán Largo as part of territorial peace implementation. BecauseThe Abrego municipal government and the UARIV have already made excellent progress together building the Community Hall, now they just need quick equipment and training support to make it operational. Quick response to these two specific needs (equipment, training) will open the door to increased government presence and JAC / community responsibility and participation in victims assistance, reparation, and other key activities for territorial agreement implementation. Experience has demonstrated that these types of tangible rapid response activities are effective for gaining community trust and building government and peace agreement legitimacy. "

Livestock is the most promising licit economic activity in El Tarra, as there are approximately 24,000 head of cattle currently among small producers. "
"If the Covencion theater is improved and it is used strategically to engage rural youth in arts and culture activities in the theater; Then Rural youth will have new opportunities for inclusion and participation focused on territorial peacebuilding, indigenous ethnic diversity and tolerance. BecauseThe Convention municipal theater is a revered regional landmark that has the power to bring community members together, including marginalized rural youth. Cultural activities in Concepcion and the region generally focus on urban audiences leaving out rural youth and other populations from key communities for agreement implementation and territorial peace. The Program has identified a network of allies among youth organizations at the regional level who are eager to engage with the activity, and use it as a spring board for new leadership. "
If We support the Sardinata municipal government lead the remodeling and equipping of the Andalucia farm house to convert it into an agricultural training center; ThenSardinanta municipality will have the facilities that are needed for youth and small farmer access to vocational and technical training to catalyze licit productive opportunities as outlined in the peace agreement. BecauseThere is high demand and levels of expectations among youth and small farmers regarding government support for agricultural vocational education opportunities outlined in the peace agreement (rural education immersion point 5). Lack of response to these demands and needs could create tensions and frustrations among the stakeholders regarding government support and the peace agreement implementation in their communities. The Sardinata municipal government is committed to supporting the youth and other small farmers focused on productive activities that are most relevant to the climate and regional value chains  and the SENA is ready to provide the vocational training. The Analucia farm house rehabilitation is a quick and tangible means for demonstrating peace benefits.

"If we enable the implementation of a program focused on supporting six arts and sports schools in the strategic community of Vega de San Antonio, Playa de Belén; Then We will help to increase visible municipal government presence and positive community stakeholder interactions and relations through arts and sports in rural areas of the municipality critical furthering peace. BecauseThe Playa de Belen municipal government recognizes the importance of improving its access, presence and relationships with local stakeholders in rural Vega de San Antonio through sports and arts programs in order to further peace. Arts and sports programs, and other cultural initiatives led by municipal government have historically only reached urban sectors and populations; therefore, it is highly important to reach out priority underserved districts like Vega de San Antonio.Arts and sports programs are an effective way to bring together key change agents within the Community Action Boards and rural leaders as well as for gaining entry into distant and underserved communities. Arts and sports programs that utilize rigorous metodologies and wide stakeholder participation can be an effective and widelyaccepted strategy in difficult contexts. "
"If we help to spearhead the preparation and execution of a ""Peace Educators"" diploma course with 70 teachers from the priority municipalities; Then We will help strengthen the capacities and leadership of a cadre of teachers to act as peacebuilding multipliers with youth at risk in the classroom and their parents in the region. BecauseTeachers have the potential to act as important and influential change agents for peace in remote rural communities with youth and parents. Teachers are protection and guidance providers for youth at risk and in critical conflict contexts, especially rural communities, teachers are the only representatives of the government. Teachers have frequent access, not only to the youth in the classroom, but also to parents, Community Action Boards and municipal government to promote nonviolence and community peacebuilding practices. The Diocese of Tibú already has formed an alliance with the Javeriana University, which has the methodology for the diploma course. "
"If we help execute three national and territorial encounters between national and territorial government decisionmakers of the Catatumbo;ThenWe can help initiate the relationship between national and territorial government decisionmakers focused on planning and implementing actions associated with the Peace Accords. BecauseCurrently the relationship between national government entities and local autorities of the Catatumbo is limited and tense, creating bottlenecks that prevent national  territorial progress in planning and taking action with the first phase of Peace Accords implementation. Providing a structured opportunity for meeting, dialogue and coordinating actions between national and territorial participants in a central place is an effective means for catalyzing collaboration and making progress with first phase Peace Accords implementation. "
"If we help the municipal government of San Calixto construct a symbolic memorial peace park; Then The leadership of the municipal administration will be made visible in terms of reconciliation and dignification of the conflict victim population. BecauseThe municipality of San Calixto has the highest number of conflict victims in the region and government has yet to follow through with symbolic, public reparations activities  causing lack of credibility and frustration among the population. It is an activity government officials identified together with the communities, and its execution will be the first experience doing joint work (government + citiznes) related to conflict victims symbolic reparations and reconciliation. If community exepectations are not fulfilled over the short term new tensions and mistrut will arise, making peace agreement implementation much more difficult. "
"If, The municipal government of Hacarí leads the construction of a strategic section tertiary road in San José de El Tarra; ThenAccess and mobility will be improved for inhabitants of San José and surrounding areas and the municipal government will be able to take on a visible leadership role. BecauseRapid response tertiary road construction is a proven strategy in conflicttransition communities for generating confidence in local government and peace in remote rural zones. The activity has been prioritized between the municipal government and the local participation as a means to bring stability and improved security to the zone. The activity is a concrete action that demonstrates the commitment of the municipal government to allocate its own resources to advance the materialization of the peace accords."
"If the Municipal Administration rehabilitates the Bobali village rural school with government leadership; ThenWe will improve conditions and access to education services for children and youth in zones critical for demonstrating government response with peace benefits. Because El Carmen municipal government and department officials have prioritized the Bobali rural school for rapid response activities to increase its presence with the aim of improving community perceptions regarding Norte de Santander institutional response as part of peace implementation. The expansion of the illicit economies and communitylevel control by armed groups has relegated the visible role of government institutions as a legitimate governance authority and service provider. The Bobali rural school is a central meeting point for community members (leaders, farmers, change agents) to meet, dialogue and engage in community activities together. "
"If, We provide smallscale infrastructure renovation and office equipment for the Farmers House of San Pablo in the Teorama municipalityThen, It will have an improved infrastructure that will enable the San Pablo Asojuntas and the Teorama municipal government to provide better services  Because,Asojuntas of San Pablo is a change agent recognized as a communal and legal authority and also as a facilitator of services among the population.Asojuntas has worked with the communities in actions and commitments that ensure coexistence and protection against the illegal armed groups in areas where the state presence is weakFarmers House is an example of  good governance, where communities feel confidence and request for social services "
"If the Mobile Unit of the Victim´s Secretariat is operational;ThenThe Secretary of Peace and PostConflict and the Victim´s Unit will be abe to rapidly decentralize integrated conflict victim´s service delivery out to priority communities. BecauseThe Secretariat of Peace and the Victim´s Unit have identified an opportunity to work together to expand services in communities with little priovious territorial presence. Priority municipal governments expect rapid response support to address their conflict victim´s needs as part of peace implementation rapid response. The Mobile Unit is a proven, effective mechanism for decentralizing and reaching remote communities for service delivery  preventing community members having to travel long distances to access services. "
"If we provide the ART with rapid material and lostical support to carryout meetings with ZVTNneighboring communities; Then Conditions will be improved for the ART to convene dialogues between communities and institutions on peace agreement implementation in ZVTN neighborning communities. Because,In the ZVTN of Caño Indio difficulties were idenfied for advancing activities that involve bringing together the community with institutions. The ART from its regional office is responsible for making progress with community assemblies and work with the ZVTNneighboring communities but they have been unable to make progress due to lack tents, tables, chairs and transport to properly convene the participants. Rapid provision of these items and transportation support will provide the basic dignified conditions to build trust and make progress with the dialogues and meetings. If the ART doesn´t act now, tensions and difficulties regarding expectations will continue to worsen in the ZVTNneighboring communities affecting institutional credibility. "
"If The Women´s Association of La Gabarra has the basic infrastructure, meat processing equipment and storage in operation; ThenWe will facilitate Women´s Association member rural livelihoods and eventual income as outlined in the Havana peace agreement. BecauseThe Association has already made great progress in making women's work visible and they are capable of accessing markets  they just need this rapid, smallscale support to become operational and benefit. The Association women members have become change agents in their communities, ""peacemakers"" and an example of the advantages of pursuing licit livelihoods. The municipal government of Tibu and the Victim´s Unit have made initial investments but fell short on fulfilling their commitment to the Association  this provides an excellent window of opportunity for Transforma to ""add the last brick"" and making the processing operational and helping the government ""make good"" on its promises."
"If We help the Ombudsman´s Office gain new access to rural communities near the ZVTN; ThenThe Ombudsman´s Office will be able expand its role in peace implementation thereby strenthening new confidence with community members.BecauseThe Ombudsman´s Office has prioritized its team reaching communities near the ZVTNs and executing sessions/fairs on protection and human rights services and information, as part of peace implementation (rapid response, access to services, trustbuilding). The arrival of the Ombudsman´s Office to the ZVTN nearby communities will help to strengthen the confidence of the population in government. The sessions/fairs will provide an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the Ombudsman´s nuetral role accompanying actions related to peace. Protection and human rights and the role of the Ombudsman´s Office is critical during the transition as social leaders and other communities are experiencing new threats and assasinations  without this support, citizen confidence in government protection will slide. "
"If the ""I´ve got a project, let´s make it a reality"" fair has robust participation of small producers and associations from key Catatumbo municipalities; ThenThey will have new opportunities to interact with territorial and national government institutions and access information, markets and tech services.Because The High Council for PostConflict, the Agency for Territorial Renovation (ART) and ProPais have a strategy to bring insitutions and small producers together as part of it´s peace agreement implementation strategy. The entrepreneurship fair is an excellent opportunity for the ART to lead a rapid response activity at the territorial level related to its small producer initiatives strategy. Visible events with wide participation can be an effective means for territorial government to demonstrate new leadership and responsibility. "
"If the La Gabarra district communities have a rehabilitated space to meet and organize activities; Then We can help increase participation of diverse stakeholders in activities that support peace and position leadership of ASOJUNTAS, Because ASOJUNTAS is a change agent that is capable of taking on leadership roles and leveraging institutional support to bring peace agreement tangible benefits down to the community level. ASOJUNTAS is a social organization in La Gabarra that can help to balance influence and interests of other farmer organizations in the region that tend to coopt and limit diverse community participation. Rapid tangible small infrastructure rehabilitation involving JACs with community participation is a proven strategy to help build trust in institutions and peace implementation.  "
"If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs carriesout sports training days in the framework of its Border Prosperity Plan and Peace Agreement implementation;ThenAuthorities, leaders and youth in strategic border zones will gain new capabilities related to sport as a tool for peacebuilding. Because  A window of opportunity exists for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lead communitylevel actions related to coexistence and peace; however, this is only possible with Transforma support for gaining access and funding shortterm technical support.  The Border Prosperity Plan and sport methodologies provide excellent vehicles / opportunities to engage authorities, leaders and youth helping to overcome political divisions and tensions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs played a key role in the Havana peace talks, and now new opportunities exist for it to engage at the territorial level in critical zones in Catatumbo with activities that support agreement implementation. "
"IFPastoral Social of Ocaña develops educational and cultural spaces for the strategy ""Artisans of Peace""THENYoung, rural residents of Catatumbo will gain knowledge on issues of peace building, the postaccord period, reconciliation and peace.BECAUSEDecreased violent actions by ELN during the peace negotiations with the government is an opportunity for local and regional institutions to develop activities at the local level Pastoral Social as an change agent and neutral actor, facilitates implementation of activities in a coordinated way with the governmentContinued implementation of the ""Artisans of Peace"" strategy by Social Pastoral is an opportunity to impact the region through a proven methodologyCultural alternatives for youth are limited, since their daily lives revolve around activities associated with illegal economies"
"If,We develop cultural and educational spaces on the final Havana Peace Agreement led by Puerto Santander municipal government and the Office of the High Commissioner for Peace (OHCP)Then, We will increase information about the steps, timeline and roles in final Havana Peace Agreement implementation in communities in Puerto SantanderBecause,The Municipal Administration has developed spaces and tools to guide communities and articulate National entities around the final Havana Peace Agreement implementation Training regarding Peace through music and social communication will be developed to and for local communitiesThis will create cultural and safe spaces for peace led by the municipal administrationThe OHCP and the mayor's office wish to have a more direct communication channel, which will allow the OHCP to understand and measure community perceptions about the peace process in this important municipality "
If we repair a Caterpillar 120g grader from the Abrego municipal heavy equipment bank;ThenWe will help increase tertiary road maintenance activities in corridors prioritized for peace implementation.BecauseThe Havana Peace agreement prioritizes moving forward quickly with tertiary road infrastructure improvements in order to demonstrate tangible peace benefits to community members and provide visible leadership and confidencebuilding opportunities for municipal government. Early regional integration through tertiary road infrastructure in strategic corridors is a critical step for peace implementation and integrated rural reforms (access to services and markets)  without which will create new tensions and frustratrions among community members will fester. The Abrego municipal government has prioritized repair of heavy equipment as it is more costeffective than purchasing new expensive equipment and it also will allow it to respond more expeditiously to community tertiary road needs and expectations. 
"If we help the El Carmen municipal with procurement of key items to address  the potable water contamination problem;ThenThe El Carmen municipal government will be able to provide a quick potable water solution that will mitigate tensions and build credibility with citizens. Because The El Carmen municipal government does not have the resources or capacity to respond to this urgent need to resolve the water contamination problem, which is causing tensions to increase and credibility to fall each day that passes. There is a window of opportunity to catalyze El Carmen municipal government leadership, governance and credibility improvements with its citizens, who are skeptical about government capacity to find quick solutions for problems related to armed conflict and peace transition. If no action is taken, the El Carmen municipal government will likely face a governance and credibility crisis that endangers future activities related to peace agreement implementation in this strategic geographic zone. "
"If the Ministry of Livestock provides awarenessraising messages at the Cure Salée around livestock management and information complementary to the vaccination campaign, then ties between communities and the Nigerien authorities are strengthened. Stronger links between GoN and nomadic communities will in turn decrease the latter ones' feelings of abandonment and exclusion, enhancing their resistance to regional pressures of instability."
"If participative theatre and mobile cinema sessions offering opportunities for dialogue and interactions within and between the nomadic communities are broadcasted at the Cure Salée, then the discussion will be facilitated. If the dialogue is facilitated on issues of concern or on particular conflict between communities, then community cohesion will improve between and within the different nomadic groups, which will in turn increase their resistance to regional pressures of instability."
"The peace and security of the countries of the SahelMaghreb are threatened by the activities of regional violent extremist organizations, organizations which recruit youth to participate and support these activities. Youth leaders in these countries have recognized the risks that these VEOs pose to their safety and security. If youth leaders from these countries are able to convene to discuss these regional threats, then they will be able to identify potential durable solutions that encourage positive youth engagement at a local level to support peace and security in their communities. Once identified, these youth can then go back to their home communities to implement these activities. If youth are positively engaged in their communities to support peace and security, then they will be less interested in and less likely to participate in extremist activity. "
"Threats to the stability of sovereign nations in the SahelMaghreb may express themselves locally, but many, such as AQIM and Boko Haram, are regional in nature. These threats cannot be addressed solely by work that does not consider the transnational, regional element of these VEOs. Moreover these threats must be addressed by working with youth as youth (ages 1535) are central to the makeup of these VEOs. If implementers and awardees from OTI's programs in the Sahel Maghreb that work with youth to support peace and security and counter instability within their communities come together, then lessons learned from the individual programs can be shared and new opportunities to enhance peace and security from a regional perspective can be explored. If lessons learned in the SahelMaghreb are shared and implemented, then the effectiveness of OTI SahelMaghreb country programs to counter instabtility will be enhanced. If OTI's programs in the SahelMaghreb are more effective in encouraging positive youth interaction in their communities, then interest to participate in illicit or extremist activities amongst youth (ages 1535) will decrease."
"Supporting 100 youth from Agadez and Diffa to attend the 9th annual National Youth Camp will increase their knowledge on critical issues affecting their communities as outlined by this year's themes surrounding peaceful elections, countering violent extremism, anticorruption, illegal immigration, sex education, and HIV/AIDS.  If these youth already identified as leaders in their communities increase their knowledge around these themes, then they will be able to identify potential durable solutions that encourage positive engagement at a local level to support these ideals in their communities.  If youth are positively engaged in their communities, assuming that they are empowered and recognized as leaders, then they will be less interested in and less likely to participate in extremist activity."
"If local researchers are trained and mentored to conduct a political economy analysis, then they will provide more sound analysis on political dynamics, both formal and informal, within Niger.  If there is a better more nuanced understanding of not only how political power is used to manage resources, but the way in which structural features, formal institutions (rules) as well as more ‘informal' norms and socialcultural and ideological factors (beliefs) shape people's choices and behaviors, then development actors can design better programmatic interventions that help increase participatory, responsive governance in the country. "
"If PCCN provides technical assistance to the Government of Niger on media and external communications then the government will have increased capacity to communicate across Ministries and with the people of Niger. Improved communications will in turn, strengthen ties among Nigerien government authorities, civil society and citizens, particularly with vulnerable populations.  "
"(IF) PCCN utilizes the unique perspective and skills to deepen the PCCN program's understanding of the tensions between the TubuTuareg communities, while also increasing the program's partner base, (THEN) the PCCN program staff will have increased their knowledge and capacity to engage a wider range of actors with substantive, accurate information on a potentially destabilizing conflict. With improved capacity, an expanded partner base, and thoroughly researched information will in turn aid the program in decreasing tensions around destabilizing conflicts. "
If NCCI obtains robust and quality research and analysis then it will support NCCI programming to become more impactful because strong contextual understanding is a prerequisite for effective and impactful programming.
"(IF) NCCI utilizes unique perspective and skills to deepen the program's understanding of CVE and targeted communities, while also increasing the program's ability to develop violent extremismrelated programming, (THEN) the NCCI program will have increased capacity to engage with a wider range of actors and approaches to address violent extremism. With improved capacity, an expanded partner base, and thoroughly researched situational awareness, the program will be better able to develop culturally appropriate responses to VE while shoring up the resilience of targeted communities.   "
"If PSAs targeting youth regarding civic responsibility, nonviolence during the election period, diminishing the TubuTuareg conflict and CVE are shared with the Nigerien public through skits and short spots on television and radio, youth implicated in these issues will reconsider their involvement in localized violence and negative engagement in their communities."
"If PSAs targeting youth regarding civic responsibility, nonviolence during the election period, diminishing the TubuTuareg conflict and CVE are shared with the Nigerien public through skits and short spots on television and radio, youth implicated in these issues will reconsider their involvement in localized violence and negative engagement in their communities."
"If implementers and awardees from OTI's programs in Niger that work to support peace and security and counter instability within their communities come together, then lessons learned from the individual projects can be shared and new opportunities to enhance peace and security in two regions can be explored. If lessons learned in Niger are shared and implemented, then the effectiveness of the NCCI program to counter instability will be enhanced. If the NCCI program in Niger is more effective, then civic engagement will be increased in areas vulnerable to conflict and the influence of extremism."
"(IF) NCCI utilizes an expert skill set to ensure the implementation of the program's activities, while also developing new programming, (THEN) the NCCI program will have increased capacity to implement its program and engage with a wider range of actors to address stability and community cohesion in Niger. With improved capacity, an expanded partner base, and compliance with standard operating procedures, the program will be able to better achieve its goals and objectives.    "
"If trainings with the theme “Peaceful electoral processes” and workshops on how to play the game ""Democrapoly"" for youth at risk organized in fadas (neighborhood groups) located in “Commune 5” and student delegations from the University of Niamey are conducted, then a sense of civic duty will civic duty through raised awareness on the electoral process will be instilled amongst atrisk youth.BecauseYouth are largely unaware of the electoral process/system, their right to vote, and general civic education making them easy targets for political manipulation  At risk youth in Niamey within the activity's targeted zone (source of beneficiary recruitment) are  often implicated in violent protestsYouth who receive trainings and/or play Democrapoly will pass key messages on to other youth via their social networksTrainers will be able to communicate training/workshop concepts in an effective manner in consideration of the educational level of all participantsUsing a game as an educational tool will help youth to retain lessons covered"
"If a song of peace (audio and video) is produced and distributed that combines Tuareg, Tubu, and Hausa languages, messages of peace and acceptance, resonating with youth, will be widely distributed throughout Agadez region. Because: Bombino, who will compose and sing the song in question is both famous and highly respected across ethnic groups in Niger As Bombino is Tuareg his employment of both Tamashek and Tubu languages in the piece will show mutual respect for both cultures, drawing both Tubu and Taureg attentionBoth Tubus and Tuaregs have a strong traditions in the arts Music is a motivating factor and a powerful tool to engage the youth of AgadezThe song will be diffused nationally, using both radio and TV channels popular amongst the youth of AgadezThe song can be used as part of future PCCN media materials/grants focusing on Tubu/Tuareg issues as well as themes of peace and reconciliation Bombino will also perform the song as part of AGA038Battle of the Bands Festival to promote peace in Agadez  (tentative) or the song will be featured via recording "
"If PSAs featuring messages of peace, tolerance and fair elections featuring 525 times  on 13 local radio stations are monitored via  reception of feedback from diverse audiences using  Interactive Voice Response (IVR)/ SMS Platform including the implementation of a  exit poll survey in Niamey, Agadez and Diffa, then PCCN will be better able to evaluate the reach and effectiveness of applied messaging. Because:  PCCN is currently conducting monitoring of PSAs through FGDs but is not unable to reach a wider audience particularly outside of Niamey region Interactive radio shows will encourage audiences to think critically regarding PSA contentLocal media stations are unable to provide data regarding viewershipCommunity radio is most accessed by the population inhabiting rural communes and the majority of the population in Agadez and Diffa region PSA audiences will be motivated to provide feedback PSA audiences will understand how to use the IVR/SMS Platform "
"If a Peace and Solidarity Caravane is carried out near 15 polling stations on election day with a standby caravane ready for deployment  in case of unrest following the elections, then tensions leading to extreme violence in key areas will be diminished because:  Protests, manifestations, violent demonstrations  are expected to occur during the electoral  period.  Residents of vulnerable communities are unaware of the electoral process/system, their right to vote, and general civic education making them easy targets for political manipulation    The lack of adequate government response to the basic needs of communities contributes to feelings of a sense of injustice of marginalization; Opposition held neighborhoods and areas where youth in particular have been excluded from the elections process, are atrisk to create physical violence after results are shared with the public (particularly in the instance of a PNDS win following the first round of elections)Reports are circulating that wealthy opposition supporters from the diaspora have returned to Niger for the elections and will not accept a PNDS win. "
"If  a 3week Cultural Festival with presentation/performances of the students attending the University of Niamey on all regions, including facilitation of discussions on the theme of peace and social cohesion is conducted, then positive exchanges between students of different social and ethnic groups will be increased, because:Students are largely proud of their heritage, including their region, ethnicity or tribe. The opportunity to display these cultural attributes to the student body appeals to their interests. Ethnic enclaves exist on campus, threatening a cohesive atmosphere Activities that increase the active participation of youth help to reduce feelings of exclusion Influential student actors can positively influence youth in order to decrease their risks of engaging with extremist ideals"
If [Provide basic sports to equipment to the handball and athletism delegations of University of Niamey] then [ University students will train and compete in inter regional competitions] because:Improved quality of and access to equipment will incentivize sports participationSports activities have a wide appeal University sports associations are currently lacking key equipment to engage in different types of sports and train in the manner needed to qualify for sports competitions 
"If a Peace and Solidarity Zone is created in Niamey's Commune 5 and a Peace and Solidarity Caravan is deployed in key areas of Niamey during the post2nd round election period, then tensions leading to electionsrelated violence in key areas will be diminished because:  Protests, manifestations, violent demonstrations  are expected to occur during the electoral period.

"If a 2day practical training on the usage and benefits of social media for  60 youth in Niamey, Agadez and Diffa is conducted, then youth capacity to use social media for positive exchange promoting peace will be increased. Because:   The Interest of youth in conducting illicit/extremist activities is significantly tied to propaganda on social media/network or misinformation spread through these networks  There are significant pockets of young people in all regions who are unaware of the full range of capabilities of social media to bring people together, engage in advocacy, and to innovate.   Youth often engage negatively on social media which fuels community and inter communal tensions  Social media can provide community for those who feel marginalized and frustrated due to unemployment or state inaction   Social media is an important tool for communication and source of information "
"If a Peace and Security Conference and Workshop, including  the role of women in preserving peace and countering violent extremism, and an essay competition among university youth in Niamey, Diffa and Agadez is conducted, women's engagement in CVE dialogue as significant agents of change will be encouraged.   Because:Women's key roles in society put them in ideal positions to prevent extremist violence.Increasing women's confidence and knowledge can lead them to harness their power within their own communities and spread information University students might be tempted or seduced by the extremist narrative spreading the information more easily among a large group of studentsThis activity would provide a platform for youth to discuss and exchange ideas and engage actively on CVE themesThe role of women is often seen as secondary concerning issues of the security Discussions which focus on women as actors of change are uncommon in Niger CVE in Niger is often seen through the lens of military force instead of a change in perceptions and opportunities at the groundlevel Youth in general (and young women in particular) are often cast aside when it comes to leadership in Niger. Their ideas are not given the same weight as their elder/male counterparts. Women have a significant role to play in CVE particularly within the family unit as matriarchsmothers, sisters and daughters."
"(IF) NCCI utilizes an expert skill set to assist the program with analysis of the conflict dynamics and develop staff capacities in situation analysis, activity design and development, and M & E as they pertain to the program goals and objectives, (THEN) the PCCN program will have increased its knowledge base and capacity to engage with a wider range of actors with substantive, accurate information on a potentially destabilizing conflict. With improved capacity, an expanded partner base, and thoroughly researched information will in turn aid the program in decreasing tensions around destabilizing conflicts. "
" If communication and IT equipment as well as an informational session on equipment usage and maintenance are provided to the regional offices of the High Authority for Peace in Niamey, Diffa, Agadez and Tillaberi, then the institutional capacity of the HACP for information sharing will be strengthened.Because:Currently communications within the HACP, between HACP and other government departments and between government officials and their constituencies are poorOne of the main threats to stability in Niger is regionalism which arises, in part, from a lack of communication between regionsIf the internal communication mechanisms of the Nigerien government at central, regional and local levels are increased, HACP's ability to prioritize key projects will improveGovernment communication vis a vis the population on security issues is paramount to ensuring communities are vigilant and aware of threatsGovernment communication to the population helps to build trust and assures the community that they have not been abandoned by authoritiesOpen communication also allows communities to raise their issues with government at the local and national levelCommunication is a key component of proper service delivery  "
"If a 3 day training retreat  for HACP civil servants based in Niamey, Diffa, Agadez and Tilaberi is organized regarding countering violent extremism in Niger and a module is provided on usage/maintenance of communications equipment provided,  then the institutional capacity for information sharing and knowledge of CVE amongst Niger's Governmental Branches will be strengthened.Because: Currently communications within the HACP, between HACP and other government departments and between government officials and their constituencies are poorOne of the main threats to stability in Niger is regionalism which arises, in part, from a lack of communication between regionsIf the internal communication mechanisms of the Nigerien government at central, regional and local levels are increased, HACP's ability to prioritize key projects will improveGovernment communication vis a vis the population on security issues is paramount to ensuring communities are vigilant and aware of threatsGovernment communication to the population helps to build trust and assures the community that they have not been abandoned by authoritiesOpen communication also allows communities to raise their issues with government at the local and national level If the internal communication mechanisms of the Nigerien government at central, regional and local CVE in Niger is often seen through the lens of military force instead of a change in perceptions and opportunities at the government level.If the internal communication and knowledge mechanisms of the Nigerien government at central, regional and local levels are increased, HACP's ability to prioritize key CVE projects will improve.Communication and interaction between different level of governmental officials  is a key component of proper service deliveryThe government is actively attempting to build its capacity on CVE related programming  Those receiving the training are influential within the HACPLessons learned in the trainings will be spread to colleagues throughout GoN"
"If support to the organization of the 2016 edition of the National Concorde Day via provision of prizes, visibility material (including social media support),  and transportation to the HACP is provided, then greater awareness and interest in the National Concord Day will be generated.  Because:The HACP does not have the financial means to procure visibility materials in order to generate wider support for the event  Without additional transport support, logistics for the event will suffer Prize giveaways and materials given to facilitate peacebuilding/cultural/sporting events will attract youth attention and participationYouth who were not yet born or of cognizant age during the Tuareg rebellion are not familiar with the conflict and its negative influences on societyVisibility for the HACP in Tillaberi is important as the state has a weak presence in the area following the Tuareg RebellionVisibility will help to reinforce that Concord day is a staterun initiative The lack of confidence in the government is particularly strong in areas at risk of negative influence from external and internal forces A lack of awareness of the HACP may preclude youth engagement during the Concord National Day Young people do not have opportunities to engage positively with community leaders and government officials Young people of Tillaberi are active on social media "
"If a documentary film about the celebration of the National Concord Day in Niger is produced, then increased interest and knowledge regarding National Concord Day and issues of peace in the region will be generated. Because: Youth who were not cognizant or born at the time of the Tuareg Rebellion lack significant knowledge and a sense of the consequences of the conflictAudiovisual content is highly illustrative and powerful particularly amongst the youthA significant portion of the population has access to television/social media in their villages/townsThe filmmaker will engage his/her audience through storytelling and high quality imagesThe filmmaker will fairly characterize all sides implicated in the Tuareg rebellionThe documentary will receive significant views on social media in addition to television viewsAuthorities and other key stakeholders will make themselves available for interviews during filmingInspirational content will encourage youth to spread news of the documentary to their social networks "
"If a departmental forum on peace and security is held in Bani Bangou, then key leaders in the area will be better informed and coordinated on critical regional stability and security issues because: The Prefecture does not have the financial means to procure visibility and media coverage in order to generate wider support for the event  ; Without additional transport support, logistics for the event will suffer ; This event will offer an open space of exchange for state authorities, community leaders and development actors to exchange on peace and security regional issues; It will better inform Bani Bangou residents on the dangers of extremism and the value of peace culture, and will contribute to fight extremist rhetoric;  The forum will be used as a framework to identify and plan actions than can help to maintain peace in the area of Bani Bangou."
"If a peace and cohesion day at the University of Niamey through the initiative of the Niger Association of Muslim Students is supported, then cohesion within the student body will be fostered. Because: Some students of the university become radicalized under the influence of the Izala/Wahabbist Movement. This group of students may selfisolate from the general student population, but remains active and in touch with religious associations on campus This event will appeal to the most conservative students and they will attend The AEMN has an important place in the life of the university and can have a positive influence on the students as an organization for change on campus This inclusive event will gather students from all origins and all academic disciplines in order to reinforce cohesion within students community; Activities such as sports and art, allow students to connect without discussion on potentially divisive topics such as religious beliefs or politics Sports and art appeal to students from all backgrounds, therefore we assume that this event will bring conservative and nonconservative students together"
"If a  peace rally with actors of civil society at the Niamey sports stadium is conducted, then Niger will be mobilized for national unity in the fight against extremism in the aftermath of the recent Boko Haram attacks on Diffa. Because:A prior protest was attempted on the same issue that was disrupted by government due to its organization by a controversial individual and lack of prior approval. NCCI's protest will be organized by a considerable number trade union and civil society leaders respected by both government and communities. Diffa is often a forgotten region that is treated as separate from the country. The rally will remind those that Diffa is Niger, and that the country is at war and must be protected. Bringing people together for a common cause can motivate the population to be engaged on the Diffa issue Diffa citizens will feel cared for when they see rallies in other areas of the country, in support of peace for their region and security. Messages by leadership speaking at the rally with convince those that the conflict in Diffa does not only concern the military and the authorities but all citizens throughout the country who must fight violent extremism together and stand for a united Niger. "
"If NCCI obtains detailed analysis on the influence of social networks on youths' choices of violent pathways, then it will enable NCCI to have more highly targeted community interventions, specifically youth programming, and will better inform decision makers and those who design counterextremism programs.

"If a CVE expert develops a tailored training curriculum, and carries out three trainingoftrainers sessions in CVE for local leaders and a pool of Nigerien CVE practitioners, then local leaders' knowledge in CVE will be improved and their ability to implement appropriate sensitization activities among target communities will be strengthened. Because:Consulting with local leaders in the field will foster local leaders' ownership of the activity, therefore reinforcing their involvement in the implementation of future restitutions with their peers and sensitization activities with target groups Conducting a local assessment, while building on the work already done by the program in the field of CVE, will help develop appropriate responses to the identified local leaders' needsSuch an assessment, taking place before the trainingoftrainers, has so far never been done by NCCIThese training will also help raise awareness of local leaders that they are the best positioned to address the threat of violent extremism in their communities"
"(IF) NCCI utilizes the unique perspective and skills of a consultant specialized in participatory theater, then the capacity of NCCI's beneficiaries and partners to engage local communities with grassroots CVE messaging conveyed through participatory theater will be increased. Because:  Currently theater troupes lack the capacity to meaningfully discuss and engage on community issues and reflect solutions to these problems in sketches resulting in community understanding and ownership of the process   Currently local troupes do not have a structured process for working with communities   There is a lack of understanding on the use of theater as a tool to discuss taboo issues that affect the stability of communities  These activities will help to finalize training processes and products that can be replicated in other grants   The consultant has a background in working with vulnerable communities globally and assisting local partners to enhance community exchange through the participatory theater processshe works specifically on issues of gender, a key area of concern for NCCI vis à vis VE"
"If implementers, beneficiaries and awardees from OTI's programs in Niger that work to support peace and security and counter instability within their communities come together, then lessons learned from the individual projects can be shared and new opportunities to enhance peace and security in the program's areas of intervention can be explored. If lessons learned in Niger are shared and implemented, then the effectiveness of the NCCI program to counter instability will be enhanced and local leaders' ability to address the threat of violent extremism in areas vulnerable to conflict will be increased."
"With a better understanding of local perceptions of instability triggers, future grant activities will be more accuratley targeted at the local causes of instability in Nirkh District."
"By conducting a media assessment of Nirkh, ASI will be more favorably positioned to identify potential grant activities that address key sources of instability or to augment grant activities with media components tailored to the community."
"By providing an opportunity for tribal elders of Nirkh to meet in a secure location and create a stabilization plan, the grant will strengthen cooperation among local communities and GIRoA and mitigate the influence of AGEs."
Supporting the Nirkh district government to become more effective and accountable to residents will help position it as the preferred provider of governance in Nirkh.
Holding a district government open house will establish lines of communication between the District Governor and his constituents and give the DG an opportunity to improve local governance.
"By improving internal communication for the district government, and developing a coordinated government communications strategy to be implemented districtwide in Nirkh, this activity will result in a coherent narrative to counter messaging by AntiGovernment Elements (AGEs) and improve the public's perception of Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA)."
"By supporting the district government in responding to and addressing community identified priorities, this activity will demonstrate GIRoA ‘s ability to provide services in Nirkh."

"By providing an opportunity for tribal elders of Nirkh to meet with the DG, the grant will strengthen cooperation among local communities and GIRoA and mitigate the influence of AGEs."
Supporting the Nirkh DDA members to become more effective and accountable to residents will help improve local governance in Nirkh.
"By establishing an association as a forum for Nirkh youth to engage in community activities, this grant will mitigate their vulnerability to insurgent messaging and recruitment efforts."
Supporting the Directorate of Education to deliver basic services to the local community will enhance GIRoA's legitimacy with its constituents.
"If the NRTI program is able to have a richer understanding of the current state of media in the northeast states, then that knowledge can be applied to  future activities in order to increase efficacy of programming and create better access to sources of credible information.If key leaders and community stakeholders, including youth, are given a media platform through radio to discuss their efforts and the importance of promoting community stability and governance, then those programs will help audiences better understand the issues addressed and strengthen community buyin of the decisions and actions that need to be taken"
"1. If access to credible information can be increased through radio programming in North East Nigeria, communities will be less vulnerable to rumors and misinformation that incite fear and violence.2. If NERI can learn more about the reach, listenership, and audience responses to radio programming content, it will be able to develop a more targeted and effective program media strategy."

"If NRTI gathers more reliable and timely information about the political and security dynamics, actors, and interventions in Yobe and Borno states, it will be able to develop a wider network of potential grantees and staff, and design more targeted and effective programs in those states."
"If the listener base to current radio programming can be increased through expanded transmission of radio content through nontraditional broadcast media, then communities will be less vulnerable to rumors and misinformation that incite fear and violence."
"By increasing access to credible information (sourced through field based stringers and providing local news updates, interviews, and feature stories with leaders and community stakeholders), communities will be less vulnerable to rumors and misinformation that incite fear and violence, because we assume that there is a dearth of information broadcast in Kanuri, and that communities use shortwave radio as a major source of information and that based on initial feedback received, the format of the show is interesting and engaging to local populations."
"By identifying opportunities for collaboration with radio stations and other media outlets throughout the northeast, as well as facilitating collaboration with the current Dandal Kura radio program, the NRTI program will be able to expand its media portfolio as well as attract a greater audience in Dandal Kura's target areas.  This is based on assumptions that there are media outlets in the northeast that are looking for new content, that stations will be willing to accept assistance, given Boko Haram's targeting of media outlets, and that based on initial feedback received, the Dandal Kura radio program is interesting and engaging to local populations and that this audience can be greatly expanded throughout the Hausa and Kanuri speaking regional population."
"By expanding the current Dandal Kura radio program outreach, as well as identifying and implementing new media strategies for the northeast and Lake Chad Basin Region,, the NRTI program will be able to attract a greater audience in the program's target areas, both for the Dandal Kura program, as well as future media interventions planned for the NRTI program.  This is based on assumptions that there is a demand in the northeast for additional media information, both over shortwave, FM radio and other sources of media, and that communities use radio (both shortwave and FM) as a major source of information and that based on initial feedback received, the Dandal Kura radio program is interesting and engaging to local populations and that this audience can be greatly expanded throughout the Hausa and Kanuri speaking regional population."

"By collecting groundtruthed information about Boko Haram's changing recruitment tactics, including locations of recruitment, recruitment methods, motivation and demographics of BH recruits, as well as demographics of BH defectors, including reasons for leaving the group, and actions after defection, NRTI will be able to better program responsive activities that address reasons for recruitment, provide opportunities for recent defectors, and provide alternatives for youth vulnerable to violent extremism.  NRTI assumes that there is an accessible population of vulnerable youth that is willing to talk openly about this subject matter, that recent defectors will be accessible to surveyors and that Boko Haram is still recruiting voluntarily, rather than through conscription and intimidation."
"1. If a Kanurilanguage radio program exists that highlights issues relevant to Kanurispeakers and has an audience among people in the Lake Chad region, those people will feel valued, less isolated, and have a sense that others care about what is happening to them, which will contribute to reducing perceptions of marginalization among Kanuri speakers, because language is an important cultural symbol and radio is a valued source of information.2. If NRTI can assist Dandal Kura in continually improving its radio content to provide communities and Dandal Kura is able to increase its listenership in the northeast; then NRTI can utilize Dandal Kura to support various program objectives and goals throughout the life of the program."
"1. If a Kanurilanguage radio program highlighting issues relevant to Kanurispeakers is broadcast to the Lake Chad region, those people will feel less isolated and be more aware of what is happening in their surroundings, which will contribute to reducing their perceptions of marginalization, because language is a cultural symbol and radio is a valued source of information.2. If NRTI can assist Dandal Kura in continually improving its radio content to provide communities with timely and relevant information; and Dandal Kura is able to increase its listenership in the northeast; then NRTI can utilize Dandal Kura to support various program objectives and goals throughout the life of the program."
"If NRTI is able to increase the professional presentation of the Dandal Kura radio program, such as developing a program soundtrack as a station identifier, this will continue to build the reputation of the program as a trustworthy and locally accepted source of news, information and entertainment. This is because the soundtrack will include local styles of music that are popular in Kanuri culture and widely listened to."
"By hiring a local consultant to coordinate, identify and implement new media strategies throughout northeast Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin Region, the NRTI program will be able to more rapidly implement programmatic changes, particularly as the Dandal Kura program moves toward a 24hour live broadcast.  This, in turn, will help attract a greater audience in the program's target areas, both for the Dandal Kura program, as well as future media interventions planned for the NRTI program.  This is based on assumptions that there is a continuing demand in the northeast for additional media information, both over shortwave, FM radio and other sources of media; and that communities use radio (both shortwave and FM) as a major source of information; and that based on initial feedback received, the Dandal Kura radio program is interesting and engaging to local populations; and that there is enough of an appetite for Kanuri language broadcasting that a 24hour broadcast could be sustained; and that the audience throughout Nigeria can be greatly expanded throughout the Hausa and Kanuri speaking regional population."
"If NRTI is able to further engage communities and share publicity about the Dandal Kura radio program through the strategic distribution of waxclothes, tshirts, polo shirts, key chains and footballs all branded with the Dandal Kura logo, then public awareness of the program will increase, along with program listenership and loyalty.  This is because we assume that there are populations that are interested in the stories presented by Dandal Kura, but do not yet have a loyal listener base, and that the materials listed are effective methods of marketing the radio program."
"1. If a Kanurilanguage radio drama is produced that highlights issues and community pressures relevant to communities in the northeast and the greater Lake Chad Basin region, then communities will respond to peace messaging in this radio drama, which will help NRTI to further engage communities with programming that mitigates conditions that allow Boko Haram to flourish.2. If NRTI can compliment existing news and government interview based programming on Dandal Kura with entertainment content that has a broader appeal, then NRTI will be able to increase Dandal Kura listenership among youth in the northeast and utilize the station to better support its program objective of reducing the appeal of violent extremism among youth. Both of these assume that radio programming is an accepted and popular media and that storylines can be produced that are interesting and engaging to listeners, particularly youth, and that radio dramas are an effective way to influence the attitudes and behaviors of youth."
"By gathering information on the current portfolio of planned WASH activities in Borno and Adamawa states, and by developing a set of program guidelines, best practices and training materials that can be used by NRTI staff in the design and implementation of WASH projects, NRTI will be able to design and implement more appropriate communitybased projects that can more effectively improve communities in the northeast.  This is based on assumptions that water conditions (including factors such as water tables and rainfall) in communities are suitable for WASH initiatives, that security will permit the identified engineer to conduct field visits and that guidelines for appropriate activities developed under this STTA will be accepted by communities."
"If NRTI sets up a hotline system that will be accessible for callers in the northeast region, and uses it as tool for administering surveys, then NRTI will be able to collect realtime information directly from targeted communities, which will be use to improve program design and generate additional evidence to showcase project impacts. Because, NRTI believes tcitizens across target communities in the region that are willing to provide voluntary feedback about NRTI activities and other relevant information regarding Boko Haram and community perceptions."
"If communities in northern Nigeria understand the reality and negative impact of Boko Haram, there will be less sympathy for the group and less appeal by people to support or join the group, because there are many people who currently do not understand how destructive Boko Haram has been and this leads them to support or accept them in some way."

If NRTI can assist Dandal Kura in continually improving its radio content to provide communities and Dandal Kura is able to increase its listenership in the northeast; then NRTI can utilize Dandal Kura to support various program objectives and goals throughout the life of the program."
"1. If a Kanurilanguage radio program exists that highlights issues relevant to Kanurispeakers and has an audience among people in the Lake Chad region, those people will have a stronger sense of community, belonging and voice, because language is an important cultural symbol and radio is a valued source of information."
"If the NSRPprovided radio equipment is moved from Kano to the NRTI office in Maiduguri, Dandal Kura will be able to begin independent broadcasting in Maiduguri sooner because moving the equipment will ensure it is not damaged or stolen."
"1. If a Kanurilanguage radio program highlighting issues relevant to Kanurispeakers is broadcast to the Lake Chad region, those people will feel less marginalized and be more aware of what is happening in their surroundings, which will contribute to reducing their perceptions of marginalization, because language is a cultural symbol and radio is a valued source of information.2. If NRTI can assist Dandal Kura in continually improving its radio content to provide communities with timely and relevant information; and Dandal Kura is able to increase its listenership in the northeast; then NRTI can utilize Dandal Kura to support various program objectives and goals throughout the life of the program."
"If a working group meeting is held among key workinglevel Government of Nigeria stakeholders to discuss efforts to counter violent extremism, this will lay a foundation of coordination among these stakeholders that will improve the GoN's response to Boko Haram, because one of the key problems preventing a coordinated GoN CVE strategy is lack of coordination and knowledge about various agencies' and offices' efforts and roles."
"By expanding the current Dandal Kura radio program outreach, as well as identifying and implementing new media strategies for northeast Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin, the NRTI program will be able to attract a greater audience in the program's target areas, both for the Dandal Kura program, as well as future media interventions planned for the NRTI program. This is based on the following assumptions: a) there is a demand in the northeast for additional media information over shortwave, FM radio, and other sources of media, b) communities use radio (both shortwave and FM) as a major source of information, and c) based on initial feedback received, the Dandal Kura radio program is interesting and engaging to local populations and the audience can be greatly expanded throughout the Hausa and Kanuri speaking regional population."
"If the NSRPprovided radio equipment is moved from the NRTI office in Maiduguri to the new studio space in Maiduguri, Dandal Kura will be able to begin independent broadcasting in Maiduguri because equipment installation is one of the essential remaining steps for startup.  "
"If community processes for reintegrating Boko Haram returnees/defectors are better understood, BH returnees/defectors will be able to return to their communities unharmed and be reintegrated. This will enhance community trust and cohesion and thereby reduce the chances for unaccepted returnees/defectors to join or remain members of insurgent groups."
"If NRTI supports a technical expert to assist PCNI in designing a communications strategy and implementation plan, PCNI will have increased capacity to communicate about its policies, strategies, priorities, and interventions, which will ultimately result in increased trust with communities in the North East. This assumes that PCNI has policies, strategies, priorities, and interventions to communicate about that communities in the North East will appreciate. It also assumes that PCNI will implement the strategy that is designed."
"If we have a better understanding of Boko Haram's operations and ohter extremist events in the region, then NRTI and USAID will be able to better plan interventions that limit instability and BH's influence because currently the information we have is sporadic and insufficient."
"If adequate generators and air conditioners are provided to the Dandal Kura radio studio and office in Maiduguri, Dandal Kura will be able continue uninterrupted broadcasting in Maiduguri because continued power supply and adequate cooling mechanisms are critical to the broadcast. "
"If we carry out an evaluation of NERI Dandal Kura cluster, then we will have a better understanding of the actual impact of the use of language and culture to combat extremism because the evaluation will help answer those questions. "
"If GoN is aware of the perspective of the community on reintegrating Boko Haram returnees/defectors, then GoN will make better and more appropriate decisions on reintegrating returnees/defectors. "
"If we engage members of a reginal youth CVE forum and network in the Lake Chad Basin by supporting network participants at the national level to develop and implement actoinable plans over a 4month period, then we will  reduce youth vulnerability to violent extremism because youth organizations currently lack a network, forum or action plans to enact their CVE agendas."
"Through implementation of the Regional CVE Youth Summit, including associated pre and postactivities highlighted herein, and utilizing the extensive experience of Search with youth engagement and CVE, the series of activities will support development of a network of youth throughout target countries who can work together, sharing lessons learned and best practices for continuous learning, reinforcement and mutual support, to counter violent extremism through the likes of Boko Haram, its affiliates and other extremists. Together, these activities will support young people to recognize themselves as the solution, and part of a global community working to prevent and resolve violent extremism."
"By creating a portfolio of communication materials to be used in NERI's Marking & Branding activities, NRTI will be able to present a professional and consistent image across all implemented projects which supports the objectives of the program. This will in turn lead to improved communication of the projects objectives and achievements to a broad audience."
"By PCNI implementing a website and email system as part a robust strategic communications strategy, it is demonstrating the national government's responsiveness to the crisis and gaining the confidence and trust of communities in the North East. This connectivity will significantly reduce the ability of extremist groups to draw on frustration with government as a radicalization and recruitment tactic. Additionally, the website will serve as a clearinghouse and information portal for government, organizations and citizens about reconstruction, including humanitarian and development, activities occurring in the North East, because information vacuums as well as misinformation from the national government perpetuates frustration and a sense of abandonment among people in the North East."
"By PCNI implementing the twoday Government Communicator's Conference as part of a more robust strategic communications strategy, it is demonstrating the national government's responsiveness to the crisis and gaining the confidence and trust of communities in the North East as well facilitating information sharing and network development among key actors participating in the conference, because we assume that part of the reason people lack confidence in their government is because of a failure in communications that stems from the lack of a cohesive and networked strategy. Thus, the connectivity through network development of key Nigerian and international actors for facilitating information dissemination and resource allocation will significantly reduce the ability of extremist groups to draw on frustration with government as a radicalization and recruitment tactic. "
"If we gain a greater program understanding of motivations for VE, reasons for demobilization and opportunities for reintegration by surveying approximately 1000 demobilized BH members then we will support NERI's program goal of reintegration of communities in the NE and be able to better design interventions to VE. "
"If NERI conducts a quantitative survey of its government responsiveness activities, then its approach to government responsiveness as a way to counter violent extremism will be better informed, because we assume the results of the evaluation will say whether our theory of change is sound and program staff will integrate findings into future program design."
"If broad audiences are made aware of the destructive effects of violent extremism through media campaigns, there will be less appeal and support for violent extremism as individuals will be able to make informed decisions that challenge the negative narrative propagated by extremist groups."
"If NERI is able to produce media content that raises awareness of its program activities and successes, these can then be used as tools to challenge extremist ideas and narratives on a national and international scale. The final videos and photographs produced as part of this activity will contribute to the larger program strategy and will be used to present the program to relevant stakeholders. "
"If we build the capacity of BOYES Officials and some NERI Staff on the fundamentals of DDR programming in Northeast Nigeria by training relevant personnel at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping and Training Center in Accra, then we will facilitate BOSG's focus on DDR issues, NERI's staff appreciation of DDR and ultimately contribute to reintegration in NE Nigeria"
"If NERI supports the organization of a oneday readout meeting with key GoN stakeholders showcasing the voices and perspectives of communities, then the government will have greater awareness of community perspectives on reintegration, allowing for more responsive national policy that reflects citizen expectations.  This assumes that the GoN has interest in learning about what communities need when it comes to reintegration and that DREP has the requisite convening power"
"If we develop a succinct and effective vehicle to communicate NERI's capabilities and positive impact in Nigeria's northeast by producing 100 targeted photos, three feature stories, 1 x 23 minute video success story, and 2 x 46 minute shortfilms focusing on NERI's approach, implementation, collaboration effectiveness, then we will increase opportunities for further program expansion, diversification, and collaboration; because we believe the lack of these products is hindering the program's ability to build the most effective partnerships."
"If we extend the shelflife of USAID/OTI/NERIsupported harvests, create market linkages for farmers to sell their products, and facilitate the kickstart of USAID's Feed the Future Program, by providing 19,360 PICS bags and training on postharvest sorting, cleaning and storage to 18 cooperatives in Biu and Hawal, then we will have helped address the economic drivers of extremism in southern Borno and contributed to NERI's nationallevel objective to reduce perceptions of marginalization among people in the Northeast, because market mechanisms have not sufficiently recovered to independently accommodate the sale of these products."
"If we develop activities that target Nigerian refugees and their host communities around the themes of youth engagement, C/PVE and media by stationing a NERIfunded STTA in Diffa, Niger for a period of 5 months, then we will have supported crossborder programming in design and implementation and ultimately support OTI's regional impact in the Lake Chad Basin because the target group is regarded by hosts as a Nigerian community and is  therefore a logical extension of the NERI program."
If we can portray the situation in north eastern Nigeria as being relevant to the entire nation using a  TV drama that highlights current social issues then we will be be able to create a sense of unity in Nigerians who will begin to understand that issues affecting one part of the country actually affect all Nigerian citizens and need a lasting national solution.  This will repair Nigeria's social fabric by uniting citizens from different ethnicity and backgrounds over common issues as the television is a popular medium to reach a wide variety of people all over the country. 
"The activity will provide the necessary data and knowledge to understand the dynamics that exists between returnees and remainees of communities that suffered from violent extremism in Borno state using IDP camps in Maiduguri Municipal Council and, Damboa and Dikwa LGAs. If the study is able to generate sufficient data on the challenges to social cohesion and existing gaps that would improve overall delivery of more conflict sensitive activities by NERI/OTI and other stakeholders intervening in the region"
"Presently, there seems to be lack of clarity among agencies of GON on the modus operandi of undertaking DDR activities and the establishment of the Operation Safe Corridor (OSC) by the military has not ameliorated the problem as expected to the lack of national framework, policies and guidelines for undertaking DDR in Nigeria. Therefore, if NERI/OTI supports CDD to facilitate a strategy session workshop, the OSC and other stakeholders would be able to develop a national framework document for the ensuring effective DDR in Nigeria and that would have positive impact on the gains over Boko Haram in North East Nigeria."
"If NERI provides Search with additional inkind support to cover the unanticipated additional costs for logistics and communications, it would be able to deliver a batter facilitated CVE Summit that is more impactful, then we will  reduce youth vulnerability to violent extremism because youth organizations currently lack a well coordinated network, forum or action plans to enact their CVE agendas."
"If we facilitate USG contribution to the Nigerian agenda on prosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration of former BH members by providing an STTA to represent USAID interests at a CTEDUNODC and ONSA dialogue in Abuja on December 1315, 2016, then we will maintain OTI and USAID's contribution to the Nigerian DDR agenda and ultimately support reintegration, because this meeting represents the first Nigerian nationallevel practitioner's meeting on prosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration. "
"If we support, monitor and manage the contracted provider in the production and broadcast of NERI's NRT053 TV drama by engaging a Script Writer/Executive Producer for 6 months with specific experience developing screen dramas addressing social and stability issues, then we will ensure that the technical, operational and programmatic aims of the activity are achieved, and by doing so, will contribute to repairing Nigeria's social fabric, because broadcast drama requires both significant technical skill and capacity to ensure aims are met."
"If NERI engages youth from Nigeria and build their capacity on the use of intellectual entrepreneurship to prevent and counter violent extremism ideology, targeted at youth in the Lake Chad region THEN the ability of Boko Haram and other extremist groups to spread their message and recruit converts would reduce BECAUSE Boko Haram and other extremist groups targets young people and use social media in spreading their messages"
"If we can have a cohort of young persons from the the core Boko Haram affected states (i.e. Borno, Adamawa and Yobe) trained on policy development, advocacy, use of social media and and empowered to engage in countering violent extremism in the North East then we would be able to develop a sustainable and long term approach for countering violent extremism in Nigeria. Because: Young persons remain the primary source of recruitment by the BH insurgents; Using modern means of communication and engagement like social media young persons are better able to reach a wider audience with simple   messages that resonates;  Young persons with the right support and mentoring would assume leadership positions in the key sectors of economy, politics and civil society  including community leadership."
"If we provide STTA Operations Coordination for the Intellectual Entrepreneurship Fellowship Cluster of Activities, then the Cluster of Activities including the 35 Fellows expected to be beneficiaries, NERI, OTI and the several Faculty will be better coordinated and managed i.e. being able to focus on achieving Cluster Goal by ensuring the timely delivery of scheduled activities and processes. This would further enhance effective coordination for process intensive activities matched with a dedicated operations personnel. "

"If we provide ongoing technical expert assistance on DDR for the NERI program, then we will ensure effective implementation of existing DDR activities and identify new programming opportunities because Mr. Piedmont possesses the requisite expertise to do this. "
If we provide STTA Social Media Campaign Consultant to support the fellows under North East Intellectual Entrepreneurship Fellowship Program THEN the Fellows would be able to have effective individual and group social media campaigns BECAUSE the success of the fellowship would be driven by how active fellows are on social media platforms  fellows social media strategies and campaigns need to be well coordinated. 
If we provide STTA Social Media Support to North East Intellectual Entrepreneurship Fellowship Program THEN the social media activities under the fellowship would receive strong technical support and effective delivery BECAUSE the activities under the fellowship are heavy on social media; a strong social medial support is necessary for developing aspect of the program and other supportive activities.
"If NERI supports the Kukah Center to organize a stakeholders meeting of religious and cultural leaders in the North East, followed by National Stakeholder's Engagement Forum in Abuja then an agreed set of principles for community reintegration will be established and communicated to the government because these religious and cultural leaders are respected individuals and the Kukah Center has the requisite convening power for this kind of engagement. "
"If we help secure Dandal Kura from potential Boko Haram threats and aggression by providing technical advice and material security upgrades to DK compound and residence, then we will enable Dandal Kura to continue its novel and important broadcast form Maiduguri and therefore build a stronger sense of Kanuri community, because Dandal Kura is now sufficiently important to both receive a direct threat from Boko Haram and be relied upon my the Kanuri community."

This assumes that the University of Diffa can organize a symposium that effectively promotes this exchange of information and lessons learned."
"If we train 25 representatives from OSC, ONSA and MWASD in DDR fundamentals to support reintegration efforts then their capacity to design, plan and implement a successful reintegration program in Northeast Nigeria will increase because OSC has limited capacity in DDR and the lack of appreciation of international best practices and crosscutting issues remains a key constraint to effective planning/coordination of reintegration efforts in the North East. "

"
"This activity assumes that by conducting documentary film screenings in the areas of Sabha, Ghat, Aljufra, Wadi Alshati, Ubari, Katrun, and Murzuq, LTI 2 will inspire and expose southern activists to international examples of nonviolent movements and broaden their understanding of civic activism alternatives.  "
This activity assumes that supporting Fezzan TV in developing and airing their summer peace campaign will highlight a positive example of how media actors can counter the prevailing narratives fueling polarization and conflict and build public interest in moderate media content that promotes dialogue and nonviolence.
"This activity assumes that by helping the Sabha Municipal Council establish, equip, and promote the Sabha Dialogue and Community Center, LTI 2 will increase opportunities for public participation in the decisionmaking processes and functions of Sabha municipal government and increase public confidence in the council's ability to provide services. "
These activities assume that the ability of municipal councils to mobilize local residents and deliver highly visible communityengagement projects would strengthen their legitimacy among citizens and enable them to play more vital role in the governance process at the local level.
"The key assumption behind this activity is that community spaces and engaging events would provide positive opportunities and encourage greater interaction between different communities, thereby helping to restore a sense of social trust and cohesion. This is because the lack of opportunities for interaction between different towns and communities in Libya has been a driver of conflict between them. "
"LTI will support alNahda Club to conduct the Marathon for National Unity and launch a series of public events in the South to educate the public and build support for the GNA. In coordination with the other elements of the broader campaign, the effort will encourage public support and pressure for the Libyan political agreement and formation of a Government of National Accord."

Traffic safety upgrades are a critical public need. Residents have raised concerns about it to school/education officials and hospital leaders, who passed on the concerns to the MC. The upgrades will clearly signal the MC's work to address public safety. The Sabha MC wants to deliver services to their community, but lacks the  resources to do so. The rehabilitation of schools zones and crosswalks in front of clinics is a highly visible, tangible project that all residents will recognize and appreciate as project completed by the MC.

"If LTI supports ministry officials, community leaders, the Sirte Crisis Committee, and Misrata MC, to refurbish schools and medical centers in Abu Grain and Wishka and conduct public outreach efforts, then there will be increased cooperation among all of these actors in addressing critical recovery needs in the Abu Grain area.  The governance situation in and around Sirte is very unclear - roles and responsibilities, legitimacy of various institutions and individuals. This includes both public perceptions and legal standing. Given the uncertainty of the local governance situation, our preliminary strategy is to promote cooperation among all relevant stakeholders - with GNA ministries and community officials in the lead. GNA ministries of health and education have a clear mandate for technical oversight of health and education services. Their involvement and leadership makes sense. Communitylevel leaders (mukhateer almahala and tribal leaders) will have more legitimacy than Misrata MC, Sirte MC, or Sirte local councils, as these local leaders are closest to and most familiar to residents. They should be in the lead in public outreach efforts. Residents in Abu Grain and Wishka are receptive to Misrata participation in these activities in their areas. All of the relevant stakeholders are interested in participating in a cooperative process to address service delivery and recovery needs, and it is important to assess the level of cooperation among these actors for future activities. LTI assumes we will be able to view and assess the cooperative process during implementation. LTI assumes residents of Abu Grain and Wishka will see the cooperation through the public outreach. The project is high visibility and high priority for families in Abu Grain and Wishka."
"If Abu Grain sublocal council and Misrata Municipal Council refurbish the Abu Grain passport office and conduct public outreach efforts, then the Abu Grain passport office has adequate resources to resume services to residents and IDPs.Because: 1Local administrative authorities (MMC and AGLC) want to resume passport services for Abu Grain and AlWishkah but facilities were damaged by the Islamic State (IS).2Community leaders, AGLC, MMC, and national authorities (Ministry of Interior) will be engaged and committed to ongoing support through the governance complex, including the passports office, in Abu Grain.3Strong public outreach efforts will inform residents about the resumption of services.4The presence of administrative and governance authorities will help reestablish law and order in Abu Grain and AlWishkah, a critical component for a peaceful return for IDPs and longterm stability."
"If LTI2 supports the Abu Grain local council and the MMC to refurbish Abu Grain civil registry office and conduct public outreach efforts, then the Abu Grain civil registry office has adequate resources to resume services to residents and IDPs.Because:1Local administrative authorities (MMC and AGLC) want to resume services for Abu Grain and AlWishkah but facilities were damaged by the Islamic State (IS).2Community leaders, AGLC, MMC, and national authorities will be engaged and committed to ongoing support through the civil registry office and services in Abu Grain.3 Strong public outreach efforts will inform residents about the resumption of services.4The presence of administrative and governance authorities will help reestablish law and order in Abu Grain and AlWishkah, a critical component for a peaceful return for IDPs and longterm stability."
"If Tanaroot provides a two weeklong psychosocial support ToTworkshop for 10 Sirte social workers and teachers and conducts 3 months ofpsychosocial support activities for Sirte IDPs in Benghazi, then teachers andsocial workers from Sirte will have improved capacity to address thepsychosocial support needs of violence affected children and communities, and Sirtechildren affected by violence will have improved access to psychosocial supportboth in displacement in Benghazi and if they return to Sirte. BECAUSE:1 The 10 Sirte teachers andsocial workers lack the advanced trainingand experience needed to help children and youth recover from displacement,violent extremism and trauma.2 The workshop training will improve the 10 teachers' andsocial workers' expertise to respond to these psychosocial support needs3 The social workers and teachers will have the opportunity toimplement and practice these skills in the 3 months of activities at Tanaroot.4 The social workers and teachers will have greater capacity toprovide ongoing psychosocial support to Sirte residents when they return toSirte.5 Tanaroot will be able to identify and engage IDP children and familiesin Benghazi who will benefit from the activities."
"If local authorities and line ministries support establishment of psychosocial counseling services in schools in the Sirte region, then the target IDP community will recognize the efforts of the authorities to respond to priority needs.Because (assumptions): 1       Psychosocial support services are a priority need. LTI 2's needs assessment in October 2016 revealed 70% percent of Sirte IDPs and returnees require psychosocial support to overcome the trauma of exposure to violent extremism, conflict, and displacement.2       (Approach) Specialized training is necessary as teachers and social workers currently lack the skills to help children recover from displacement, violent extremism and trauma. Creation of “safe spaces” for delivery of this service is necessary as those facilities are currently absent. 3       (Approach) Strong public outreach efforts will inform families about the psychosocial support in the targeted schools and the role of the relevant local and municipal authorities to facilitate this support."
"IF Herawa MC restores functionality of the harbor for the fishing industry, THEN the confidence in the MC's response to priority community needs will be strengthened. BECAUSE: The new equipment (industrial refrigeration and ice production) will enable Herawa fishermen to fish for longer periods of time to increase output, store fish longer at the harbor, and sell fish locally. The harbor is a priority need relevant to the community. Fishing is one of the main industries in Herawa and was devastated by Islamic State occupation of the area in 2016.The area has good natural conditions for fishing and skilled fishermen. Public outreach efforts in Herawa and beyond will inform both the fishermen, vendors, and the community about the rehabilitation and the MC's role."
"IF Herawa MC restores the Herawa Sewing Factory to full functionality, THEN the confidence in the MC's response to priority community needs will be strengthened. BECAUSE: The factory is a priority need for the community. Around 40 families/women in Herawa previously relied on the facility to help generate a source of income for their household and they want to use the facility again now that they have returned to Herawa Looting of equipment and materials is the main obstacle preventing the facility from operating, as the building itself is still in good shape  Users will resume applying the factory's  preexisting model for sustaining the center (e.g. users pay a fee or portion of what they sell)  Public outreach efforts in Herawa and beyond will inform families/women from Herawa area about the rehabilitation and the MC's role.  "
"IF Abu Grain local authorities establish a job skills training center serving Abu Grain and AlWishka THEN Abu Grain residents and IDPs will have strengthened confidence in the Abu Grain sublocal council and Misrata Municipal Council's response to community recovery needs.Because (Assumptions):1.Economic recovery is at the forefront of priority needs postIS. According to LTI research, 45% of Sirte's IDPs are unemployed (compared to 10% before displacement). 2.Due to disruptive conflict and IS occupation, the Sirte region has fallen behind in skills needed in the emerging and recovering local job market. The center, in consultation with stakeholders, will determine what skills are most needed and design courses to address these skills. 3.Residents and IDPs in Abu Grain and Wishka areas want to learn skills to help them seek and find jobs, and local authorities want to support this process. This assumption is based on an informal assessment LTI 2 conducted through information gathered from the Misrata MC, Abu Grain sublocal council, and CSOs in Sirte and Abu Grain. 4.(Approach) Strong public outreach efforts will inform residents about the establishment of the center and the role of the relevant local and municipal authorities to facilitate this economic recovery effort. LTI2 knows from FRAP research the combination of services with outreach messaging is the most effective means for building MC credibility. "
"IF the Herawa MC refurbishes the AlKhaleej Stars Cultural and Social Club, enabling it to provide psychosocial support activities for children and youth,THEN the Herawa MC will gain increased credibility in the eyes of its constituents. BECAUSE: LTI2 inkind support will enable Herawa MC to provide a venue with services to address trauma experienced by children and youth who were exposed to conflict and extremism.  Psychosocial support activities were identified as a community priority. Public outreach efforts in Herawa and beyond will inform the community that the HMC active in addressing a community needs.  Herawa MC wants to address community priorities but lacks the resources to do so."
"If VISTAS conducts new reearch and analysis of the politics behind the conflict, then VISTAS/USAID will better understand the current politicalmilitary situation of the country particularly related to IOShiluk militias, because changing circumstances on the ground have made previous understandings of the context less relevant and new information is required to understand the new alliances and groupings which are occuring."
"If VISTAS provides media support for grant activities in South Sudan; then future programming in support of media objectives will be better planned, targeted and implemented; because the support will provide assistance in grant implementation,  a  understanding of media related issues and the way in which VISTAS programs have and can affect the ability to project media content into South Sudanese audiences"

"If SRP2 supports partner travel to Turkey for the purpose of facetoface discussions of local conditions, priorities and challenges, SRP2 will gain a better understanding of emerging windows of opportunity in Syria, resulting in better projects and increased confidence in moderate opposition structures and civil society organizations."
"If Enab Baladi produces 12 reports on the relevance as well as roles and responsibilities of moderate civilian governance and civil society, then residents will become aware of the relevance of these entities and their integral role in healthy, stable democracy. This is because residents have limited access to information of these bodies and systems. "
"If USAID/OTI supports the Syrian Civil Defense (SCD) mobile response team then the SCD will have an increased capacity to respond to support newly liberated areas, provide surge support to centers with limited resources, and also support the establishment of new centers. This will result in increased and improved service delivery, which in turn will build public confidence and support for the SCD. While in Idleb province, if USAID/OTI enables the SCD to expand the services in newly established centers, it will introduce a moderate Syrian opposition entity to these territories where other moderate entities, such as local councils, do not operate. This will prevent extremist or armed groups from maintaining a monopoly on service delivery in these areas. At existing centers that will receive the assistance, the skidsteer loaders will result in improved service delivery in Idleb, also resulting in further public confidence in the SCD. "
"If SRPII supports the Duma Local Council to expand and improve management of civil records and land titling services, then the Duma LC will be seen as more transparent and effective in this key governance role, because these services are important to residents, and delivering them consistently and professionally will increase public support for the Council."
"If the HPC, working with local councils, establishes a bakery and is able to provide bread to eastern Hama residents, then the HPC will gain legitimacy and popular support among communities of this area, thereby preserving its role as a moderate civilian opposition entity in the face of potential ISIS expansion.  Because Eastern Hama has historically been neglected (even prior to the revolution) any group that is able to demonstrate that it is able to quickly and effectively respond to a urgent community need will gain the support and backing of the local population. "
"If SRPII supported the Idleb Provincial Council (IPC) to establish a bakery in Ma'ar Shemsheh, then the IPC will be able to extend its reach and visibility within the province, leading to increased public perception that the IPC is a credible and responsive provincial governing institution. Since bread used to be subsidized by the Syrian government, it is one of the most visible means through which the IPC and local councils can be seen as a formal and unified governing structure within the moderate Syrian opposition."
"If the ACC provides materials for neighborhood councils to repair water wells, then citizens will credit the ACC for resuming the water service and the ACC and neighborhood council's credibility will be increased.  It will also decrease the space for GSA to step in and provide this service. This is because the visible demonstration of the ACC effectively responding to a priority community need will build their legitimacy as a municipal governing body as well as decrease the chances of the GSA to win community support in this area.  "
"If the IPC collaborates with local councils to provide 7,000 hygiene kits to IDPs, then they will gain public support and favor of the local population, because they will be seen as providing relevant and critical relief during an emergency situation.

"If the Aleppo Provincial Council (APC) provides hygiene kits to LCs in the southern and western countrysides that will be distributed by the LCs to IDPs, then the residents and IDPs will favorably view the LCs and APC. As a result, the LCs and APC will accrue public support and legitimacy as moderate governing entities. This is because by meeting the urgent needs in the south and west (which are currently to address the IDP issue) public support for the APC and LCs will be increased and moderate civilian governing space will be protected. "
"If USAID/OTI supports the Syrian Civil Defense (SCD) to rent the vehicles to serve as pack up assistance to Homs directorate then the SCD will be able to maintain its ability to respond to community needs.

"If USAID/OTI supports the Syrian Civil Defense (SCD) with light and medium equipment, spare parts, and expendable supplies then the SCD will be able to maintain its ability to respond to community needs. This will result in increased and improved service delivery, which in turn will build public confidence and support for the SCD because of the critical nature of the services provided by the SCD."
"If SRPII supports the local councils of Darayya, Duma and Al Marj to provide emergency relief services as part of a unified campaign, then these moderate governance entities will be seen as part of a broader, moderate opposition movement working as a united front to support their communities amid a massive crisis. As a result of this responsiveness, these councils will be seen by their communities as moderate, legitimate, and viable alternatives to a brutal dictatorship on the one hand, and armed groups seeking to claim political space, on the other. "
If SRP II provides higher quality outreach materials to partners to use for outreach and awareness activities then this will lead to the creation of a more effective moderate narrative that is better able to compete with that offered by extremist groups because currently SRP II partners do not have the capacity to produce high quality materials and extremist groups do. 
"If IPA produces and broadcasts media related to opposition governing bodies and civil society, then viewers will become aware of efforts of these entities, because without this support, citizens will not know about the work of these local bodies and they will be less inclined to support them. "
"If AMC produces 12 reports related to opposition governing bodies and civil society, then citizens will be aware of the efforts of these bodies as well as their integral role in a healthy democracy.  This is because citizens have limited public access to information regarding the work of local councils."
"If Aks Alser produces 12 reports related to opposition governing bodies and civil society, then citizens will be aware of the efforts of these bodies as well as their integral role in a healthy democracy.  This is because citizens have limited public access to information regarding the work of local councils."
"If SMG maintains the Ma3koum page with creative and attractive material that promotes the role opposition governing bodies and civil society, then citizens will be aware of the efforts of these bodies as well as their integral role in a healthy democracy.  This is because citizens have limited public access to information regarding the work of local councils."
"If the HPC, working in collaboration with with local councils, is able to quickly and effectively distribute assistance to IDPs, then the HPC will increase its popular support because the HPC will be seen by the IDPs and the community as responsive to their needs."

A stronger SCD means improved resource allocation and strategic planning, which leads to improved service delivery for citizens resulting in higher public confidence in the SCD as an institution and thereby curbing the extent to which extremist groups can secure popular support. "
"If USAID/OTI supports the Syrian Civil Defense (SCD) to rent vehicles and provide protective gear to Rural Damascus directorate then the SCD will be able to maintain its ability to respond to community needs. This will result in increased and improved service delivery, which in turn will build public confidence and support for the SCD because of the critical nature of the services provided by the SCD."
"If provincial councils and the Supreme Council of Provincial Councils improve their public engagement efforts then residents will become aware of efforts of these entities, because without these efforts, citizens will not know about the work of these local bodies and they will be less inclined to support them. "
If SRP II provides this media activist with IT and communication equipment then the media activist is better equipped to promote moderate and progressive values capable of countering values promoted by extremist groups because without this support the media activist does not have the equipment necessary to produce quality materials.
"If USAID/OTI supports the Aleppo Provincial Council (APC) to rapidly reequip its main headquarter that was targeted by a Russian airstrike, then the council will be able to get back to work quickly and maintain its important role in providing assistance to the citizens of Aleppo (during a particularly crucial time when then are fierce battles happening in the southern countryside). If residents believe the APC is responsive to needs, they will increase support for this institution."
"If moderate Syrian opposition entities are able to quickly deploy resources in response to political developments in Syria, such as the liberation of territory, communities will have increased public confidence in, and support for, these entities. If moderate opposition bodies are unable to demonstrate their relevance and fill these governance and service delivery voids, public confidence in these entities will decline and there will be opportunities for extremist or military groups to enter this space."
"If SRPII supports the Al Marj Sector Local Council to plant, harvest and store wheat of 750 dunams, then the Al Marj Sector Local Council will gain popular support. This is because the council will be able to meet needs that are critical to the community while curbing warprofiteering by private merchants or armed groups. "
"If SRPII supports the Duma Local Council to plant, harvest and store wheat harvested from 600 dunams, then the Duma Local Council will gain popular support. This is because the council will be able to meet needs that are critical to the community while curbing warprofiteering by private merchants or armed groups."
"If the Darayya Local Council moves to new offices located in basements, they will be able to operate more efficiently in a safer environment. This is because staff will be less worried about the risk of attacks and air raids and will focus more on their mission. Additionally, being located together in one space will result in better  communications between different departments since they were divided into separate offices previously. "

Due to the centralized structure and management of security and public affairs of of the state, leaders rarely have the opportunity to give their own contribution in the security sector. Radio messaging is an effective means of communication in rural areas."

The project is high visibility and high priority for IDP families, and IDP families will remain in these locations for at least the duration of the school year We assume that schools would register more IDPs students after the refurbishments of the extra classrooms and the activity will reduce overcrowding for both local residents and IDPs.

Residents and he MC are interested in communication with each other. However, residents do not have much information about the MC or what it does, as LTI has discovered from survey results. From the MC side, they lack both capacity and resources for communication.  The media office is an important bridge between the MC and residents. Equipping and empowering them to facilitate and promote this initiative will give them the opportunity to interact with many different residents, CSOs, and community leaders  strengthening these relationships. So, it will build their capacity to promote and communicate about other MC efforts and projects in the future.   The community competition will be an effective opportunity for MC to interact directly with many representatives of different groups in the city. We assume the CSOs involved will represent many different constituencies, interests, and neighborhoods, and this process will be an important opportunity for interaction and relationshipbuilding. This direct interaction is a more effective means of communication  The strong involvement of the civil society sector is critical here, as we assume that civil society groups can serve as an important link between local government authorities and the MC, and civil society groups play an important role in representing and mobilizing various constituencies.  This activity involves and will fund some small community improvement projects. However, the key focus of the activity is not the service delivery processes.

BECAUSE:  Youth from western Libya towns are willing to interact and address issues peacefully.  The interaction between youth in a positive environment will lead to stronger relationships between the youth and their communities.  A decreased likelihood of local conflicts will allow people and communities to more easily reject violent extremism.

"(1) If we engage idle combatage youth in productive, nonviolent activities, then this productive use of time might serve to motivate the youth to resist involvement in the violent national level conflict  because such activities will allow the youth to feel the satisfaction and selfconfidence that come from involvement in productive work and play; such activities will provide a greater awareness of their potential and open their minds to the notion that their lives can amount to more than idleness, poverty, and violent confrontation. Bottom line, positive/productive activity may give them more of a reason to live than they currently have. (2) If we barrage Bor town with peace messaging delivered via a number of vehicles/contexts, then we will increase awareness and contribute to shifting the collective mindset toward peace  because peace concerts, football matches, peace marches, mass grave memorials will (a) serve as reminders as to the toll of war and the benefits of peace; (b) influence younger demographics by exposing them to cultural, intellectual, athletic, artistic leaders extolling the virtues of peace; and (c) as scientific study into mass commnication suggests, influence the population simply by exposing them to consistent positive messages of peace."

"1. If communities in Yobe are engaged through the creation of conflict management councils to carry out quick interventions on emerging conflicts, then communities will more capable to prevent and mitigate conflict and violence will decrease. 2.

It is assumed that, the more youth became aware of the potential threats of violence to their society, the more empowered they are to rise up against violence and become better prepared to counter the threats themselves."
"If youth are empowered with peacebuilding skills and economic opportunity, they would be less vulnerable to joining violent extremist groups (such as Boko Haram).

"If stakeholders from citizen groups and government response agencies in Damaturu increase their ability to recognize and report early warning signs for insurgent activities, then communities in Damaturu will be able to better report early suspicious activities that may be signs of extremists activity, thus diminishing the impact of Boko Haram activities.  This training will also help security and other relevant agencies address suspicious behaviors and the smuggling of light ammunition into Yobe. This will, in turn, reduce the recurrent insurgents attack in Damaturu and Yobe state at large, reducing the tendencies of violence to occur and contribute to building lasting peace in Yobe.  The assumption behind this theory is that stakeholders are not currently reporting suspicious behavior because of a lack of knowledge and understanding of early warning, reporting and monitoring."
"If NRTI provides a platform for engagement between Government and school children most of whom are youth towards nation building, unity and nationalism, then the youths will have a sense of belonging to a nation hitherto occupied by Boko Haram and will also have feelings that they are engaged in the course of nation building. This will make them more patriotic to their country and clear illusion made by Boko Haram of creating a sovereign state in this part of the country. "
"When the Almajiris who happened to be less enlightened and more impoverished are empowered economically, they become self reliant and their appeal to violent extremism as a result of financial inducement becomes diminished and their possible recruitment into terrorist groups like Boko Haram is curbed. Because The almajiris lack neither financial support from the government nor feeding allowance from their parents. They live a miserable life by begging food from the public as a means of livelihood. This makes life miserable to them and made them so frustrated with government and a willing tool to be manipulated by extremist groups such as Boko Haram who use their predicaments as an advantage to entice them with money to join their groups. "
"If youths have positive social networks (peace tournament), they would be less vulnerable to joining violence extremism group (such as BH). Because, NRTI believed lack of positive social network among youth in the Northeast (especially Damaturu), has contributes to youths idleness, as a result of that, many youths became frustrated, and joined violence extremism group (like BH). "
"If communities (especially youths) have increased awareness on the negative impact of Boko Haram ideology, then people would have less appeal to violence extremism ideology. Because NRTI believed, many people in Yobe joined Boko Haram, due to lack of awareness on the negative impact of Boko Haram ideology. "
"Developing counter-narratives to Violent extremist ideology with the same instruments Boko Haram is using to gain support, will assist in elimination of such negative ideology and facilitate preventing the growth of this appeal to violent extremism particularly among those who see it as some sort of religious obligation. Since Boko Haram is presenting itself as a religious movement, If counter narratives to Boko Haram ideology are developed by religious leaders, it will make potential recruits or sympathizers less prone to joining such group. We assume that these potential recruits and sympathizers can be swayed away from BH ideology by intellectual discourse and debate."
"If CSOs in Yobe state have their capacity built in in proposal development, organizational management, budgeting, financial management, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting, they will be better position to implement successful projects and programs that will Improved government responsiveness to citizen expectations, reduced perceptions of marginalization among people in the NE of Nigeria and thus reduce the appeal of violent extremism (VE) among youth in the NE of Nigeria. The assumption is that CSOs in Yobe are currently unable to implement these types of activities because they do not currently have these skills."
"In consideration of the unifying factor of football and the level of its acceptance among youth in Damaturu, it is assumed that if these football pitches are established and a football tournament is played, then it will promote youth engagement with Government in the area of sports because this activity will provide them with the opportunity to showcase their talent, increase social bonds, and adopt a spirit of sportsmanship thereby making them less prone to violent extremism. If NRTI support the Yobe State and Local Government to setup sporting centers and host peace tournament for youths in Damaturu. This will increased positive social network among youths which subsequently would reduce youth frustration with government and communities. Because NRTI learnt that, lack of sporting activities for youths has contributes to a lack of a sense of purpose and frustration with Government and their communities, which makes them more vulnerable to joining violence extremism Ideology groups (like Boko Haram)."
"If NERI supports the establishment of a youth cafe with IT training equipment in Damaturu, then youth from different ethnic and religious backgrounds will have a platform for positive social interaction, which can reduce their mistrust and frustration with government and communities because NERI has learned that a lack of social platform for youth interaction in Damaturu and Yobe state at large contributes to youth's mistrust and frustration with government and communities, which make them more attracted to joining violence extremist groups such as Boko Haram.  "
"If Government Day secondary School Damaturu is renovated and repaired by the Yobe State government, then youth frustration with their government's lack of responsiveness will reduce and their perception of government will improve, because youth expect the government to respond to citizens expectations in improving condition of teaching and learning environment to students and teachers."
"If Yobe State Universal Basic Education Commission fence AL Ansar Model Nursery and Primary School Damaturu, then residents of the community will appreciate Government responsiveness to their need thereby reducing their frustration with Government and make them less appealing to Violent Extremism, because the activity will address their need of having a secured and convenient teaching and learning environment to their wards which they have been yearning for."

"If IDPs were provided with portable radios by their government, it will enable them have access to credible information on things happening around their environment as well as giving them opportunity to make their own views and contribute to their communities through the existing radio platform (Dandal Kura).Thus, reduce perceptions of marginalization among them showing the government in the lead in improving access to credible, locallanguage information."
"By increasing efficiency and reducing the time it takes to produce bills of quantities and quotation for prices,, NRTI will be able to implement more appropriate communitybased projects that can more effectively improve communities in the northeast. This projects will in the long run improve communities perception about quick government response to their infrastructural needs.  This is based on assumptions that the technical support will reduce the long wait in preparation of these technical documents often undertaken by NRTI staff who do not necessarily possess the technical skills required for preparing these documents."
"If youth have the opportunity to participate in peace and unity clubs, then they will have strengthened positive social bonds and engagement with their communities, therefore reducing the appeal of violent extremism because youth will have more awareness on importance of peace to their future and the consequences of violent extremism to societal development."
"If NERI supports the Yobe State Government to provide desks to select public schools in Damaturu through the Yobe State Universal Basic Education Commission, then community perceptions of government will improve because NERI learned from the Independence Day Celebration post evaluation survey under YOB007 that communities in Damaturu have been requesting the Yobe State Universal Basic Education Commission to provide furniture to public schools throughout the LGA."
"If NRTI supports the Yobe State Government, through the state Ministry of Water, to provide additional sources of potable drinking water in selected communities in Damaturu, then it will improve people's perception about the Government because NRTI has learned that the lack of resources (funds and materials) of the Yobe State Government to provide these communities with access to potable water has significantly contributed to increased frustration with Government. Due to this frustration, alternatives promoted by violent extremist groups such as Boko Haram may become more appealing to residents of these communities."
"If NERI supports the Yobe State Government, through the Potiskum LGA to provide boreholes to communities, then it will improve people's access to usable water and subsequently this will reduce citizen frustration with Government. Because NERI learnt that lack of provision of water by the Government in these communities has significantly contributed to communities' frustration with Government, which as a result many people across these communities seeks alternative form of government by embracing Boko Haram Ideology."
"Lack of electricity to power these motorized boreholes has contributed to the acute shortage of water across these communities, which led to increased community's frustration with the state government due to its failure to provide the electricity. If the Yobe State Water Corporation upgrades these six boreholes, then it will improve the communities access to potable drinking water and subsequently, their perception of the government responsiveness to the citizens' expectations will improve. "
"If platform is created for positive social engagement of youths in peace building and community participation (Peace cap and Clubs), they will have sense of purpose and will contribute positively to their communities, Because lack of positive engagement of youth in Damaturu has led to frustration of youths and resulted to acceptance of Boko Haram due to perceived disengagement and marginalization."
"If Ideal Nursery and primary school is rehabilitated, then there will be increase in positive engagement between government and community members, which will lead to increase in trust and citizen satisfaction, because the Government addresses their educational need ."
"If youth from the two warring parties were engaged in peace building and community service, then it will foster unity and harmony among them, because they will work for a common goal of improving their environment which affects them all. If drainage is constructed in Potiskum, it will improve people's perception on the local authorities because it addresses their age long environmental problem."
"If we improve the functional efficiency and operational capacity of Damaturu BEST center, through provision of equipment and training facilities, then there will be trust and satisfaction among citizens because they will see the government showing commitment to the needs of youth there by diminishing opportunity for Boko Haram to compete for relevance and legitimacy in the sight of the population."
"If we support the government to respond to community needs by rehabilitating the recreational facility for children and youth that have been traumatized during the Boko Haram attacks, it will relieve them of the memories of encountered horror and will serve as a sign of normalcy being returned thereby improving government responsiveness."
"If the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) engages the graduates of the Damaturu BEST center through industrial attachment and providing kits to the trainees, then they will demonstrate government efforts to improve their livelihood opportunities, thereby increasing trust and satisfaction among citizens because they will see the government showing commitment to the needs of citizens there by diminishing opportunity for Boko Haram to compete for control of the population.  This assumes that the lack of government followup with graduates is a significant source of frustration and that an attachment and startup kit will improve their alternative livelihood opportunities."
"If Youth in Damaturu and Potiskum were supported in celebrating the International Youth Day, then, they will become more enlightened on their role in maintaining a peaceful society, because of the peace building messages that will be mainstreamed in the event."
"If Ministry of Education holds Independence Day celebration with primary and secondary school students, then youths will have opportunity to showcasetheir talent and patriotic zeal for nation building, this will increase sense of belonging and feelings that they are engaged in the course of nation building. Thus, make them more patriotic to their country and clear illusion made by Boko Haram of creating a sovereign state in this part of the country."
"If we create platform for Government and communities to engage, there will be greater interaction because of improved service delivery and understanding as the community members will feel honored when their voices were heard and their opinions sought for the stability of their society which will raise their hope in getting the solution to their problem from within themselves rather than succumbing to the campaign from Boko Haram."
"If we provide assistance of food items to these communities who are suffering from acute food shortage in the name of the government at this critical period, the people will be happy with the government and will see it as being responsible and responsive to their needs for food to survive. It will be a good entry point for the success of our subsequent activities as we will have the good will from major stakeholders in these new LGAs we are about going into."
"If we revive and improve the functional efficiency of Geidam BEST center, through renovation and provision of equipment and training facilities, then there will be trust and satisfaction among citizens because they will see the Government showing commitment to the needs of youth there by diminishing opportunity for Boko Haram to compete for relevance and legitimacy in the sight of the population."
"If we support the Yobe state Council for Arts and Culture to present a stage drama and symposium in Geidam LGA on Deradicalization as a panacea for community resilience, then there will be community resistance and diminished appeal to VE ideologies because community members will be enlightened, decisive and have a good sense of reasoning to counter the narrative of Boko Haram."
"If we support Yobe State sports council to organize traditional dance and games for returning IDPs in Geidam, then there will be less space for VE to infiltrate, because social and community bond will increase which reduce the appeal of youth to violent extremism."
"If the capacity of religious and traditional leaders is built in conflict sensitivity, peaceful religious messaging and resilience, then it will assist in reducing appeal to violent extremism among their followers because of the influence they exert in molding attitude and behaviors of people."
If the women are enlightened on CVE and economically empowered they help their children with their economic needs to which they derive the legitimacy to be listened to by their children whose character they now influence thereby making the chance of Boko Haram to have any legitimate authority on their children due to economic dependence virtually none or very slim.
"If we promote peace and religious tolerance among youth in Geidam and Yunusari LGAs, then youth will be less likely to be either vulnerable to violent extremist recruitment or a source of instability in their communities themselves because lack of opportunities to engage positively is a driver of extremism in Geidam."
"If we support Geidam Local Government to respond to community agricultural needs, then positive perception of government will increase resulting in a decrease in support for VEOs, because it gives people sense of belonging and satisfaction of needs in the area of food security and economic strengthening and challenges the narrative of the VEOs."

"If NERI supports Yunusari Local Government Council to support 1200 farmers with improved variety seeds, fertilizer and tractor hire, then it will improve farming activities in the area which will make them food secure and lessen citizens' frustrations with local authorities because the LGA is responding to improving their means of livelihood."

"Small businesses are the backbone of local economies.  This project has the potential to be an effective tool for stabilization by engaging youth in peaceful employment opportunities and avoid insurgent intrusion.

"One of the greatest weaknesses of GIRoA is its inability to bring together representative groups of citizens to work with it to establish effective social services. This activity assumes that shura engagement at the village level, immediately after clearing operations, will be the first step in a large scale effort by the District Governor to address community grievances and issues.

There is at present only one functioning school in Zhari district outside of the Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camp. The community of Zhari district has requested the District Governor to provide schools for their children.
